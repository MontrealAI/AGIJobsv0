# Emergency Operations Runbook

This document outlines the procedures operators should follow when responding to
production incidents involving the SelfPlay arena, StakeManager, and related
services.

## 1. Immediate Pause Procedures

1. **Identify the affected components.** Check orchestrator logs and the
   monitoring webhook for alerts (look for `moderation:` or `auto-slash:`
   reasons). Determine whether the issue is isolated to the arena contracts or
   involves system-wide concerns.

2. **Pause on-chain contracts.** Use the Hardhat script `scripts/owner.pause.ts`:

   ```bash
   pnpm ts-node scripts/owner.pause.ts \
     --arena <ARENA_ADDRESS> \
     --stake-manager <STAKE_MANAGER_ADDRESS> \
     --system-pause <SYSTEM_PAUSE_ADDRESS> \
     --pause
   ```

   - Add `--dry-run` to preview changes.
   - To resume, replace `--pause` with `--unpause` once remediation is complete.

3. **Freeze orchestration state.** Ensure no new rounds are started while the
   contracts are paused. The orchestrator scoreboard will record ongoing
   failures and helps confirm that no additional slashing occurs while you
   triage the issue.

## 2. Role Revocation & Credential Rotation

If an orchestrator key or validator lock manager is compromised:

1. Review the current assignments with the scoreboard snapshot stored in
   `storage/orchestrator/scoreboard.json` and the latest run receipts
   (`storage/orchestrator/runs/`).

2. Remove compromised actors and grant replacement permissions with
   `scripts/owner.setRoles.ts`:

   ```bash
   pnpm ts-node scripts/owner.setRoles.ts \
     --arena <ARENA_ADDRESS> \
     --stake-manager <STAKE_MANAGER_ADDRESS> \
     --revoke-orchestrator <OLD_OPERATOR> \
     --allow-orchestrator <NEW_OPERATOR> \
     --dry-run
   ```

   - Repeat with `--allow-lock-manager` / `--revoke-lock-manager` for the
     StakeManager validator lock managers.
   - Re-run without `--dry-run` to apply the changes.

3. Confirm the updates by querying the contract (`setOrchestrator` and
   `validatorLockManagers`), and ensure the orchestrator runner is restarted if
   credentials changed.

## 3. Parameter Adjustments & Fee Splits

When anomaly response requires rebalancing incentives (e.g., tightening
committee stakes or modifying fee distribution):

1. Fetch the current configuration. The monitoring alert payload and the
   orchestrator receipt `timings.scoreboard` section provide the latest context.

2. Run `scripts/owner.setParams.ts` to tune rewards, committee size, reward
   splits, or StakeManager fee percentages:

   ```bash
   pnpm ts-node scripts/owner.setParams.ts \
     --arena <ARENA_ADDRESS> \
     --teacher-reward 150000000000000000000 \
     --validator-stake 5000000000000000000 \
     --teacher-split 6000 \
     --student-split 2000 \
     --validator-split 2000 \
     --stake-manager <STAKE_MANAGER_ADDRESS> \
     --fee-pct 4 \
     --dry-run
   ```

3. After verifying the dry run, rerun without `--dry-run` to broadcast the
   transactions. Watch for the `ParametersUpdated` events on-chain to confirm.

## 4. Manual Slashing & Scoreboard Reconciliation

1. Use the orchestrator logs (`status.logs`) and the persisted scoreboard to
   identify the offending validator. Slashing actions are logged with messages
   like `validator slashed: moderation:block`.

2. Invoke `SelfPlayArena.reportValidatorMisconduct` for targeted slashing if
   automated handling is insufficient. Ensure the arena is paused first to
   avoid conflicting state transitions.

3. After executing the slash, run the scoreboard enrichment tool to update the
   culture reward ledger:

   ```bash
   python -m orchestrator.tools.culture_rewards --total 1500 --top 8
   ```

   The resulting JSON is saved to `storage/orchestrator/culture_rewards.json`
   and can be referenced when preparing weekly reward distributions.

## 5. Post-Incident Checklist

- Resume contracts with `scripts/owner.pause.ts --unpause` once validated.
- Re-enable orchestrator automation and verify new rounds close without
  generating alerts.
- Archive the monitoring webhook payload and run receipts in the incident log
  for audit purposes.
- Communicate parameter or role changes to the wider operations team.

Maintaining these procedures ensures rapid containment of slashing anomalies
while keeping governance parameters aligned with production requirements.
