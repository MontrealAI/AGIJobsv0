# Populate this file with maintainer SSH signing keys in the format:
# maintainer@example.com namespaces="git" ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3...
#
# The release workflow uses the keys listed here to run `git tag -v` on
# release tags. Keep the keys hardware-backed when possible (e.g. YubiKey)
# and rotate them if compromised. Leaving this file empty causes CI to
# fail release pipelines to prevent unverifiable provenance.
