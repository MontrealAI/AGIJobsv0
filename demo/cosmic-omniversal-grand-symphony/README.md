# Cosmic Omniversal Grand Symphony Demo üåå

The **Cosmic Omniversal Grand Symphony Demo** delivers the ‚ÄúAGI Jobs v0 (v2) ‚Äì First-Class Operating System Demonstration üöÄ‚Äù using only battle-tested functionality that already ships in this repository. It layers a non-technical launch guide, push-button orchestration, and audit-grade evidence on top of the proven `demo:agi-os` rehearsal so that any operator can run the entire mission with zero code edits.

> **Mission** ‚Äì prove, end-to-end, that a single click gives a business owner unstoppable control over a planetary AGI labour market while keeping every contract parameter, pause switch, and governance lever under their authority.

## Core Capabilities

- üöÄ **One command orchestration** ‚Äì wraps the one-click Docker stack, executes `npm run demo:agi-os:first-class`, and streams emoji-coded progress updates so non-technical stakeholders always understand what is happening.
- üõ∞Ô∏è **Owner supremacy** ‚Äì regenerates the Owner Control Authority Matrix, Mermaid governance diagrams, and timelock ownership ledger showing exactly how the owner can pause, resume, or retune every module immediately.
- üì¶ **Audit & compliance** ‚Äì outputs Markdown, JSON, and HTML dossiers under `reports/agi-os/` with SHA-256 manifests that match the CI artefacts. Every file is timestamped for evidentiary use.
- üß≠ **Wizard-guided inputs** ‚Äì reuses the existing one-click deployment wizard so operators choose networks, governance keys, and environment settings through guarded prompts instead of manual file edits.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safety-first defaults** ‚Äì honours the repository‚Äôs secure deployment posture (contracts paused on boot, conservative thresholds, timelock forwarding) so the owner retains total control while the demo runs.

## Quick Start (Zero Code Required)

1. **Install Docker** ‚Äì Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) or Docker Engine + Compose (Linux) is enough. Node.js is vendored inside the repo toolchain.
2. **Clone the repo** ‚Äì `git clone https://github.com/MontrealAI/AGIJobsv0.git && cd AGIJobsv0`.
3. **Launch the symphony** ‚Äì run either command:
   - `npm run demo:agi-os:first-class`
   - `demo/cosmic-omniversal-grand-symphony/bin/grand-symphony.sh`
4. **Answer the wizard prompts** ‚Äì pick your preferred network (local Hardhat by default), confirm Docker Compose start-up, and approve the deterministic ASI take-off rehearsal.
5. **Open the live interfaces** once instructed:
   - Owner Console ‚Üí `http://localhost:3000`
   - Enterprise Portal ‚Üí `http://localhost:3001`
   - Validator Dashboard ‚Üí `http://localhost:3002`
6. **Review the evidence bundle** ‚Äì inspect `reports/agi-os/` for `grand-summary.md`, `grand-summary.html`, the Owner Control Matrix, manifests, telemetry JSON, and Mermaid diagrams.

A green run here equals a green rehearsal of the CI v2 pipeline ‚Äì compilation, deterministic simulation, governance verification, and manifest hashing all succeed in lockstep.

## Artefact Map

| Artefact | Location | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Grand mission summary (Markdown) | `reports/agi-os/grand-summary.md` | Executive story of the AGI OS mission run. |
| Grand mission summary (HTML) | `reports/agi-os/grand-summary.html` | Browser-friendly rendition for board/executive review. |
| Owner Control Matrix | `reports/agi-os/owner-control-matrix.json` | Enumerates every governable module with update scripts and config status. |
| Control systems map | `reports/agi-os/first-class/owner-control-map.mmd` | Mermaid diagram of ownership, timelocks, and pause routes. |
| First-class telemetry | `reports/agi-os/first-class/first-class-run.json` | Step-by-step log of orchestration phases, durations, and exit codes. |
| SHA-256 manifest | `reports/agi-os/first-class/first-class-manifest.json` | Audit ledger linking each artefact to its digest, byte size, and timestamp. |

All directories are recreated on each run and include ISO 8601 timestamps for compliance.

## Full Flow

1. **Preflight checks** ‚Äì validates Docker/Compose availability, Node version, git cleanliness, and environment readiness using existing verification routines.
2. **One-click deployment** ‚Äì drives `npm run deploy:oneclick:wizard`, generating fresh `deployment-config/generated` assets and populating `.env` parameters.
3. **ASI take-off mission** ‚Äì triggers `npm run demo:agi-os`, running the thermodynamic labour market simulation, compiling contracts, executing deterministic jobs/validation, and capturing telemetry.
4. **Governance synthesis** ‚Äì rehydrates the Owner Control Authority Matrix, Mermaid diagrams, and system pause status so the owner sees every lever and the active timelock routing.
5. **Audit packaging** ‚Äì renders Markdown ‚Üí HTML, builds manifests, and archives stdout/stderr under `reports/agi-os/first-class/logs`.
6. **Integrity verification** ‚Äì cross-checks manifests, hash coverage, and matrix totals. Any drift raises an immediate ‚ùå status with remediation hints.

The orchestration terminates with a compliance recap that mirrors the CI summary job. If any prerequisite fails, the wizard displays a plain-language fix so non-technical users can resolve it quickly.

## Operating After Launch

- Use the **Owner Console** to unpause modules, adjust protocol parameters, or forward governance calls through SystemPause with a wallet click.
- Submit a production-grade job through the **Enterprise Portal** ‚Äì the validator queue updates in real-time and exercises the end-to-end labour pipeline.
- Trigger an emergency stop instantly with `npm run owner:command-center -- --action pause-all --network <network>` ‚Äì the demo preserves full owner supremacy and never revokes critical permissions.

## Resetting Between Runs

```bash
rm -rf deployment-config/generated \
       reports/agi-os \
       reports/asi-takeoff
```

Re-run the grand symphony command to regenerate every artefact from scratch.
