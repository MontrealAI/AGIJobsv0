# Omni-Sovereign Ascension Operating System Showcase ðŸš€

The **Omni-Sovereign Ascension Operating System Showcase** packages the existing `demo:agi-os:first-class` pipeline into a concierge-grade experience for non-technical operators. It leverages the battle-tested automation that already ships with AGI Jobs v0 (v2)â€”no new smart contracts or bespoke binaries are introduced. Instead, we provide a hardened orchestration script, clear UX guidance, and audit-ready checklists so that a business stakeholder can launch the entire AGI Jobs operating system (including blockchain deployment, ASI take-off rehearsal, owner control matrix synthesis, dashboards, and mission dossier generation) with a single command.

This showcase intentionally **reuses only upstream functionality**:

- Infrastructure bootstrapping is delegated to the Docker-based one-click deployer (`npm run deploy:oneclick:wizard`).
- The flagship OS demonstration is powered by `scripts/v2/agiOsFirstClassDemo.ts` (`npm run demo:agi-os:first-class`).
- Governance controls, dashboards, and validation UIs come from the existing Owner Console, Enterprise Portal, and Validator UI containers defined in `compose.yaml`.
- Safety and audit guarantees inherit the proven CI v2 workflows, coverage gates, and owner-control assets that already ship in `reports/agi-os` and `docs/`.

Together, these components deliver a **push-button, planet-scale operating system rehearsal** that remains production-grade and fully governed by the contract owner.

## 1. Zero-to-Orbit Launch (One Command)

The fastest way to witness the full operating system in action is to run the launch script bundled with this showcase:

```bash
npm run demo:omni-sovereign
```

The script performs the following high-level actions:

1. Runs the **One-Click Deployment Wizard** with safe defaults, deploying the complete AGI Jobs v0 (v2) stack to the local Anvil network inside Docker containers.
2. Invokes the **First-Class Operating System Demo**, which compiles the contracts, executes the deterministic ASI take-off labour-market simulation, synthesises the Owner Control Authority Matrix, emits live progress indicators, and packages an audit-grade mission bundle under `reports/agi-os/first-class/`.
3. Prints the URLs for the Owner Console, Enterprise Portal, and Validator Dashboard so the operator can immediately interact with the running stack via large, friendly action buttons.

> ðŸ’¡ **Non-technical ready:** The wizard provides descriptive prompts (with defaults you can accept by pressing Enter), while the demo automatically answers any follow-up confirmations. No manual editing of JSON or environment files is required.

## 2. Manual Launch (Step-by-Step)

Prefer to run each step explicitly? Follow this pathâ€”every command below already exists in the repository:

1. **Bootstrap environment variables (optional)**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:env
   ```
   This mirrors the one-click helper that fills in `deployment-config/oneclick.env` with safe local settings.

2. **Deploy the full stack with guided prompts**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:oneclick:wizard
   ```
   Respond to the prompts (press Enter to accept the defaults). The wizard provisions Docker containers, migrates contracts, publishes ownership snapshots, and pauses all modules for safety.

3. **Execute the first-class operating system rehearsal**
   ```bash
   npm run demo:agi-os:first-class -- --auto-yes
   ```
   The script streams colourised status updates for each pipeline stage. On completion you will find:
   - `reports/agi-os/grand-summary.md` â€“ executive-friendly mission dossier
   - `reports/agi-os/owner-control-matrix.json` â€“ machine-readable owner command centre map
   - `reports/agi-os/first-class/first-class-manifest.json` â€“ SHA-256 integrity manifest for every artifact

4. **Open the user interfaces** (Docker Compose exposes them automatically):
   - Owner Console: http://localhost:3000
   - Enterprise Portal: http://localhost:3001
   - Validator Operations Centre: http://localhost:3002

   Each UI includes explicit confirmation buttons, live status boards, and form-driven workflows for creating jobs, reviewing submissions, or issuing governance actions.

## 3. Mission Playbook

To support high-stakes production rehearsals, consult the accompanying [MISSION-PLAYBOOK.md](./MISSION-PLAYBOOK.md). It contains:

- A preflight checklist confirming Docker, Node, and Compose versions.
- A live-ops timeline detailing when to run the wizard, the demo, and UI validation flows.
- Explicit owner-control drills (pause/unpause, parameter updates) executed via the Owner Console or existing Hardhat scripts.
- Audit log collation steps, including how to verify `first-class-manifest.json` hashes and cross-check the CI v2 pipeline status.

## 4. Owner Control Guarantees

The showcase emphasises that **the contract owner retains complete control** over every protocol lever:

- The generated Owner Control Matrix enumerates all managed modules and surfaces any configuration gaps.
- The Owner Console exposes pause/resume toggles and parameter update forms backed by the existing `SystemPause.executeGovernanceCall` capabilities.
- Emergency operations are backed by runbooks (`npm run owner:emergency`) and pause tests (`npm run pause:test`).

Operators should review the matrix inside `reports/agi-os/grand-summary.md` after each run and execute drills from the playbook to familiarise themselves with every lever.

## 5. CI v2 Readiness & Verification

This showcase does not replace the CI v2 pipelineâ€”it makes it more accessible:

- Re-running the demo on a clean tree mirrors the CI execution path (compilation, deterministic simulation, artifact generation). Any CI failure will also surface here.
- Use the existing guardrails to **triple-verify** production readiness:
  - `npm run lint:ci`
  - `npm run test`
  - `npm run coverage:check`
  - `npm run check:access-control`
  - `npm run ci:verify-branch-protection`

Document every run by storing the terminal transcripts alongside the mission bundle for auditability.

## 6. Extending or Customising the Demo

Because the showcase relies exclusively on upstream scripts, the contract owner can customise parameters without touching code:

- Adjust deployment parameters in `deployment-config/oneclick.env` before launch.
- Pass `--network sepolia` to `npm run demo:agi-os:first-class` to target the Sepolia preset after populating the required RPC credentials.
- Use the Owner Console to update fees, staking thresholds, treasury wallets, or to pause specific subsystemsâ€”changes are immediately reflected in the generated mission bundle.

Should you need to iterate on mission narratives or visuals, simply edit the Markdown assets in this directory; the underlying automation remains unchanged and production-hardened.

---

**TL;DR** â€“ Press the big green button (`npm run demo:omni-sovereign`) and watch AGI Jobs v0 (v2) orchestrate a full operating system rehearsal, complete with blockchain execution, live dashboards, and audit-grade documentationâ€”without writing a single line of code.
