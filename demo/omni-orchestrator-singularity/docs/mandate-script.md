# Project Meridian Mandate Prompt

Paste the following text into the One-Box chat input to reproduce the Project Meridian scenario deterministically:

```
Launch Project Meridian: a multinational initiative to design, deploy, validate, and hand over a continent-spanning high-speed rail corridor linking Aurora Prime (Nation A) and Meridian Arcology (Nation B). Budget 100000 AGIA, six-month horizon. Require dual validation per milestone, energy telemetry logging for thermodynamic rewards, and owner-governed contingency drills. Stage deliverables for survey, civil engineering, maglev deployment, validator oversight, and final audit handover.
```

The orchestrator will respond with a structured plan composed of distinct work intents, validator duties, and thermodynamic audit hooks. Continue with the simulated confirmation prompts until execution completes.
