# üéñÔ∏è AGI Jobs One‚ÄëBox üëÅÔ∏è‚ú®

The One‚ÄëBox demo turns AGI Jobs v0 (v2) into a single conversational surface where a non‚Äëtechnical user can design, verify, and execute institutional-grade on-chain work. This directory packages the orchestrator server, the walletless One‚ÄëBox UI, and owner observability tooling into a launch kit that boots in under two minutes.

## Why this matters

* **One command, production power.** `npm run demo:onebox:launch` builds the static UI, starts the orchestrator with your relayer key, and serves a pre-configured chat interface that already knows where your contracts live.
* **Planner ‚Üí simulator ‚Üí executor transparency.** The UI surfaces every stage (LLM plan, policy simulation, guarded execution) so that anyone can supervise decisions before a single wei is moved.
* **Owner-first governance.** The orchestrator inherits the full AGI Jobs v2 owner surface‚Äîpause switches, fee tuning, staking limits, and ENS registry overrides. The demo ships with a doctor script that checks configuration health before launch.
* **Demonstrably unstoppable.** Every successful run emits a CID for the attested receipt, explorer links for on-chain actions, and a risk trail that compliance teams can archive.

```

The orchestrator keeps ownership controls in the loop at every stage‚Äîjobs are blocked if organisational caps are exceeded, paused if the owner toggles SystemPause, and automatically documented through attested receipts.

## Quickstart (non-technical friendly)

1. **Install dependencies (one time):**
   ```sh
   npm ci
   ```
2. **Prepare configuration:**
   ```sh
   cd demo/One-Box
   cp .env.example .env
   # edit .env with your RPC, registry address, and relayer key
   ```
3. **Verify readiness:**
   ```sh
   npm run demo:onebox:doctor
   ```
   The doctor checks required environment variables, pings your RPC to confirm the active chain, verifies that `JOB_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` points to live bytecode, inspects port availability before launch, surfaces active guardrail caps, prints the launch URL, and reminds the operator of the core owner-control commands.
4. **Launch the One-Box:**
   ```sh
   npm run demo:onebox:launch
   ```
   * Builds the hardened static UI (`apps/onebox-static`).
   * Boots the orchestrator on `ONEBOX_PORT` (default `8080`).
   * Serves the UI on `ONEBOX_UI_PORT` (default `4173`) with the orchestrator URL, prefix, API token, and mode pre-filled through query overrides.
   * Opens your browser pointing at `http://127.0.0.1:4173/?orchestrator=‚Ä¶&oneboxPrefix=‚Ä¶` so the first message can be sent immediately.

That is all a non-technical operator needs: visit the chat, describe the job, confirm, and watch the receipt appear with an explorer link.

#### Command-line overrides

Need to tweak ports or skip automatically opening a browser tab? The launcher accepts friendly flags:

```sh
npm run demo:onebox:launch -- \
  --no-browser \
  --ui-host 0.0.0.0 \
  --ui-port 5050 \
  --orchestrator-port 9090 \
  --max-budget 120 \
  --max-duration 14 \
  --orchestrator-url http://demo.internal:9090/onebox \
  --prefix /mission \
  --token demo-api-token \
  --mode expert \
  --explorer-base https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/ \
  --welcome "Welcome to AGI Jobs Mission Control" \
  --examples "Deploy data labeling | Finalize job 77"
```

Only the flags you specify are overridden; everything else continues to flow from `.env`. Invalid flag values (for example, a negative port) are rejected up front so operators catch mistakes before the orchestrator boots.

`--max-budget` and `--max-duration` provide on-the-fly organisational guardrails, mirroring the `ONEBOX_MAX_JOB_BUDGET_AGIA` and `ONEBOX_MAX_JOB_DURATION_DAYS` environment variables. Use them to demo how the contract owner can ratchet limits without redeploying.

#### Personalise the assistant surface

Set `ONEBOX_UI_WELCOME` to change the first assistant banner (for example `Welcome to AGI Jobs Mission Control`) and `ONEBOX_UI_SHORTCUTS` to seed ready-made prompts. Shortcuts accept pipe-separated strings, newline-delimited lists, or a JSON array, so operators can ship curated demos like:

```sh
ONEBOX_UI_WELCOME="Deploy your sovereign AGI workforce in one chat." \
ONEBOX_UI_SHORTCUTS='["Spin up 500-image labeling run", "Finalize job 128", "Audit receipts for job 77"]' \
npm run demo:onebox:launch -- --example "Schedule weekly research digest, 8 AGIALPHA" --welcome "Mission deck armed and ready."
```

The launcher merges CLI flags and environment variables, de-duplicates prompts, and forwards them to the static UI via query overrides so the non-technical operator lands on a perfectly staged experience every time.

### Built-in safety rails

* **Walletless default.** Guest mode uses the relayer key supplied in `.env` to sponsor gas and escrow the reward. Expert mode can be toggled at any time to emit calldata for self-signing wallets.
* **Policy enforcement.** The orchestrator reads organisational caps (`ONEBOX_MAX_JOB_BUDGET_AGIA`, `ONEBOX_MAX_JOB_DURATION_DAYS`) and halts execution with human-readable errors when limits are exceeded.
* **Resumable context.** Query parameters automatically persist the orchestrator URL, `/onebox` prefix, and mode. API tokens are applied for the current tab only so they are never written to storage.
* **Audit artefacts.** Each execution stores a signed receipt CID. IPFS credentials in `.env` let the orchestrator pin specs and deliverables.
* **Owner telemetry.** The One‚ÄëBox mission panel now calls `/onebox/governance/snapshot` to render live fee, stake, and identity guardrails so operators can confirm the owner surface is in control before releasing funds.
* **Automatic hardening hints.** The launch kit flags unsafe configurations‚Äîsuch as sharing an HTTP endpoint or omitting an API token when the orchestrator is public‚Äîand now blocks port collisions before the orchestrator boots so operators can correct issues in seconds.

## Configuration reference

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `RPC_URL` | JSON-RPC endpoint used by the orchestrator provider. |
| `JOB_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` | Address of the deployed AGI Jobs job registry. |
| `ONEBOX_RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY` | EOA key that signs transactions on the user‚Äôs behalf. Fund with ETH + AGIALPHA. |
| `ONEBOX_API_TOKEN` | Optional bearer token protecting `/onebox/*`. Leave empty for local demos. |
| `ONEBOX_PORT` / `ONEBOX_UI_PORT` | Ports for the orchestrator API and UI server. |
| `ONEBOX_PUBLIC_ONEBOX_PREFIX` | Prefix inserted before planner/simulator endpoints (defaults to `/onebox`). |
| `ONEBOX_PUBLIC_ORCHESTRATOR_URL` | Public base URL announced to the UI. Defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:${ONEBOX_PORT}`. |
| `ONEBOX_UI_DEFAULT_MODE` | `guest` for relayer mode, `expert` for wallet calldata generation. |
| `ONEBOX_UI_WELCOME` | Optional welcome banner rendered as the first assistant message. |
| `ONEBOX_UI_SHORTCUTS` | Optional shortcut prompts (`|`/newline separated or JSON array) rendered as preset pills. |
| `ONEBOX_MAX_JOB_BUDGET_AGIA` | Optional per-job reward ceiling enforced before execution. Blank disables the cap. |
| `ONEBOX_MAX_JOB_DURATION_DAYS` | Optional lifecycle limit in days; jobs exceeding it are blocked before funding. |
| `PINNER_*` | Optional IPFS pinning credentials to persist specs/receipts. |

## Owner control & observability

The demo never bypasses AGI Jobs v2 governance. Operators retain full control:

* `npm run owner:surface` ‚Äî inspect every module‚Äôs owner address and governance target before going live.
* `npm run owner:update-all` ‚Äî apply updated fee, stake, and policy parameters from `config/`.
* `npm run owner:system-pause` ‚Äî exercise the emergency pause drill; the One-Box will surface the pause status to end users immediately.
* `npm run ci:verify-branch-protection` ‚Äî confirm branch protection and CI checks before promoting changes.

`demo/One-Box/bin/doctor.cjs` bundles these reminders and verifies environment health. It is written for business operators who need confidence without touching Solidity or Hardhat.

## Continuous integration alignment

The root `pretest` script now bundles One-Box URL override tests and the launcher configuration tests. CI remains ‚Äúfully green‚Äù when:

* `apps/onebox/test/query-overrides.test.ts` confirms the query override bridge between CLI and UI.
* `demo/One-Box/test/launcher.test.cjs` validates environment merging and launch URL synthesis.
* Existing Solidity, Foundry, and E2E suites continue to run unchanged.

## Extending the demo

* **Deploy to staging:** point `ONEBOX_PUBLIC_ORCHESTRATOR_URL` at a remote host, open the UI port, and the same static assets work from IPFS, S3, or ENS gateways.
* **Custom prefixes:** set `ONEBOX_PUBLIC_ONEBOX_PREFIX=/sovereign` and the CLI will reconfigure the UI through query overrides, keeping the chat experience seamless.
* **Expert-only launches:** set `ONEBOX_UI_DEFAULT_MODE=expert` to have the chat default to calldata generation for compliance-sensitive workflows.

## Frequently asked questions

**Can multiple operators share one relayer?** Yes. Use a low-privilege relayer account, rotate keys via `.env`, and pin receipts for every run. The orchestrator enforces job ownership and can be paused instantly.

**Does the UI expose ENS/stake requirements?** Planner warnings and guardrail badges describe missing identity requirements, stake levels, and budget caps. The operator never sees raw revert reasons.

**How do I export transcripts?** Receipts include IPFS CIDs plus explorer URLs. Combine them with the structured logs (`onebox.plan.*`, `onebox.execute.*`) emitted by the orchestrator for full audits.
