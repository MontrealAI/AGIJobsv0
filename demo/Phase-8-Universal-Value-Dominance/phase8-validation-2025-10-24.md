# Phase 8 validation report — 2025-10-24

## Runtime + CI checks
- `npm run demo:phase8:orchestrate` regenerated the Safe batch, telemetry brief, Mermaid map, runbook, and self-improvement payload directly from the manifest (`demo/Phase-8-Universal-Value-Dominance/config/universal.value.manifest.json`). Outputs now carry a 2025-10-24T16:18:52Z timestamp across the runbook and plan payload, and the telemetry report echoes the manifest governance addresses, coverage, and funding metrics. 
- `npm run demo:phase8:ci` revalidated the manifest schema, confirming five domains, three sentinels, and three capital streams with 2,700s of total sentinel coverage and 7,200s cadence alignment.

## Manifest alignment
- Global governance addresses, domain caps/autonomy, sentinel bindings, and stream funding declared in the manifest mirror the regenerated telemetry briefing and Safe calldata payload.
- The orchestrator continues to source every artifact from the shared manifest path, while the dashboard (`index.html`) resolves the same JSON for its data bindings.

## Contract posture
- `Phase8UniversalValueManager` keeps every mutating pathway gated behind `onlyGovernance`, including global parameter updates, pause forwarding, registry CRUD, and self-improvement logging. Events remain comprehensive for domains, sentinels, streams, and plan updates, and helper guards enforce address, heartbeat, coverage, and URI constraints.

## Drift + follow-ups
- The Safe batch metadata still records `createdFromSafeAddress` as `0x000…000` because the orchestrator defers to the `PHASE8_MANAGER_ADDRESS` environment variable; operators must inject the live Safe before execution.
- Self-improvement artifacts report a 2025 generation timestamp while `lastExecutedAt` and next-run scheduling remain anchored to a 2023 epoch. Governance should reconcile the cadence anchor or update the manifest before deployment.
