# Phase 8 — Universal Value Dominance Demo

> **Mission**: let a non-technical governor command a superintelligent, DAO-governed economy with a single console. This demo
> packages governance calldata, observability, safety guardrails, and self-improving automation into one copy/paste friendly
> experience powered by **AGI Jobs v0 (v2)**.

## 🚀 Quickstart for operators

1. **Install dependencies** (one-time):
   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```
2. **Generate calldata & telemetry**:
   ```bash
   npm run demo:phase8:orchestrate
   ```
   You will receive:
   * Encoded `setGlobalParameters`, `setGuardianCouncil`, `setSystemPause`, and self-improvement plan calldata.
   * A full register/remove multi-call manifest for **every** domain, sentinel, and capital stream — copy/paste ready for
     Safe / timelock batching.
   * A human-readable network telemetry report with resilience, value flow, sentinel coverage, and self-improvement guards.
   * A copy/paste mermaid system map for status updates and incident briefings.
   * Autogenerated files in `demo/Phase-8-Universal-Value-Dominance/output/`:
     * `phase8-governance-calldata.json` — canonical manifest of encoded calls + metrics.
     * `phase8-safe-transaction-batch.json` — Safe Transaction Builder template (set `PHASE8_MANAGER_ADDRESS` / `PHASE8_CHAIN_ID` env vars to customise target).
     * `phase8-telemetry-report.md` — executive briefing markdown for stakeholder distribution.
     * `phase8-mermaid-diagram.mmd` — raw Mermaid blueprint for design docs.
   > **Tip**: export `PHASE8_MANAGER_ADDRESS=0x…` and `PHASE8_CHAIN_ID=1` (or your deployment chain) before running the script to pre-fill the Safe transaction batch with production parameters.
3. **Launch the control surface UI** (no build step required):
   ```bash
   npx serve demo/Phase-8-Universal-Value-Dominance
   ```
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the live dashboard.
4. **Enforce readiness in CI**:
   ```bash
   npm run demo:phase8:ci
   ```
   This validates the manifest schema, README sections, and UI mermaid placeholders. The same check is enforced on every PR
   via the `ci (v2) / Phase 8 readiness` workflow.

## 🧭 Why this demo matters

* **Universal authority with hard guardrails** – the new `Phase8UniversalValueManager` contract keeps the owner in absolute
  control of domains, sentinel policies, capital streams, and emergency pause forwarding.
* **Planetary telemetry in one command** – governance can read resilience, autonomy, value flow, and sentinel coverage from the
  CLI and UI without touching Solidity or Hardhat.
* **Self-improving and self-checking** – an on-chain self-improvement charter (plan hash + cadence) plus manifest playbooks let
  the operator launch automated retraining and adversarial stress-tests while ensuring autonomy stays bounded.
* **Mermaid-first storytelling** – every run emits a rich diagram to explain how trillions in value flow through the
  superintelligent mesh.

## 🧱 Smart contract control surface

`contracts/v2/Phase8UniversalValueManager.sol` introduces a governance-only registry for Phase 8:

* **Global parameters** – `setGlobalParameters`, `updateManifesto`, and `updateRiskParameters` let the owner reshape treasury,
  vaults, knowledge graphs, and risk tolerances atomically.
* **Sentinel lattice** – register, update, and toggle sentinels that monitor domains. Each sentinel enforces coverage windows
  and can be routed through the shared `SystemPause` via `forwardPauseCall`. Domain bindings are configured via
  `setSentinelDomains` so every sentinel only monitors approved dominions.
* **Capital streams** – register autonomous treasury programs with annual budgets and expansion curves. Governance can pause,
  re-target, or re-bind the domain list at any time with `setCapitalStreamDomains`.
* **Domain dominion** – configure orchestration endpoints, vault limits, and autonomy bps per domain while guaranteeing slug
  uniqueness and heartbeat invariants. Domains, sentinels, and streams can also be removed entirely (`removeDomain`,
  `removeSentinel`, `removeCapitalStream`) with automatic pruning of bindings.
* **Self-improvement charter** – `setSelfImprovementPlan` and `recordSelfImprovementExecution` keep the cadence, plan hash,
  and audit trail of upgrades under direct governance control.

The contract emits deterministic events so dashboards, subgraphs, and auditors can stream changes. All mutative calls remain
`onlyGovernance`, satisfying the requirement that the owner can reconfigure everything – including pausing – at will.

---

## 🧠 Self-improvement kernel

The manifest + contract encode a self-improvement plan:

* **Charter hash + cadence** – `setSelfImprovementPlan` writes the plan URI, cadence, and cryptographic hash on-chain so every
  upgrade is pre-committed and auditable.
* **Execution receipts** – `recordSelfImprovementExecution(executedAt, reportURI)` appends a tamper-evident log of each training
  and evaluation cycle, binding it to an IPFS report.
* **Playbooks** trigger weekly hyperparameter evolution and hourly stress-tests, each bound by cryptographic guardrails
  (checksum verification, zk-proof-of-alignment, multi-agent cross-checks).
* **Autonomy guard** enforces ≤8,000 bps autonomy, a 15-minute human override window, and escalations through guardian council,
  DAO emergency levers, and sentinel lockdown.
* **Validator feedback loops** reward resilient domains (resilience >0.9) with higher capital allocation while surfacing low
  resilience for governance review.

Running `npm run demo:phase8:orchestrate` surfaces these guardrails alongside calldata so operators never miss a safety step.

## 🛰️ Demo control surface

Open [`index.html`](./index.html) to explore the fully client-side control room:

* Planetary stats (value flow, budget, resilience, sentinel coverage).
* Domain cards with autonomy bps, resilience, heartbeat, and skill badges.
* Sentinel lattice view with live coverage, sensitivity, and domain bindings (auto-highlighted when a domain loses coverage).
* Capital stream portfolio with annual budgets, vault routing, and linked dominions.
* Self-improvement plan (hash, cadence, report URI) plus playbooks and guardrails rendered with owner addresses.
* An auto-generated Mermaid diagram illustrating governance, sentinels, and capital flow.

## 📦 Automated exports for governors

Running `npm run demo:phase8:orchestrate` now writes a ready-to-run export kit inside [`output/`](./output/):

* **Calldata manifest** – `phase8-governance-calldata.json` collates every encoded call with accompanying telemetry metrics for audit trails.
* **Safe Transaction batch** – `phase8-safe-transaction-batch.json` drops straight into the Safe Transaction Builder so operators can execute Phase 8 upgrades without editing hex manually.
* **Telemetry briefing** – `phase8-telemetry-report.md` summarises resilience, autonomy, and funding posture for distribution to stakeholders or incident command.
* **Mermaid blueprint** – `phase8-mermaid-diagram.mmd` reproduces the architecture map for docs, wikis, or governance proposals.

These exports ensure a non-technical owner can move from manifest to multisig execution, executive briefing, and architectural storytelling in minutes.

## 🧪 Phase 8 CI enforcement

A new job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` named **Phase 8 readiness** runs on every PR and on `main`:

1. Installs dependencies via `npm ci`.
2. Executes `npm run demo:phase8:ci` to validate the manifest, README, and UI hooks.
3. Asserts that **every** domain has sentinel coverage and surfaces the coverage totals. If any dominion slips without a
   watchdog, the build fails instantly.
4. Publishes a summary in the GitHub Checks UI so branch protection (`ci (v2) / Phase 8 readiness`) must be green before
   merging.

## 📚 Related orchestration hooks

* [`demo/Phase-8-Universal-Value-Dominance/scripts/run-phase8-demo.ts`](./scripts/run-phase8-demo.ts) – generates calldata,
  telemetry, and the mermaid diagram. Outputs now include full multi-call batches for registering or removing every domain,
  sentinel, and capital stream so governors can rehearse or execute reconfigurations without editing code.
* [`demo/Phase-8-Universal-Value-Dominance/scripts/validate-phase8-config.ts`](./scripts/validate-phase8-config.ts) – schema
  validation enforced by CI.
* [`orchestrator/extensions/phase8.py`](../../orchestrator/extensions/phase8.py) – runtime adapter so Python orchestrators can
  consume Phase 8 manifests (see below).

---

## 🧠 Orchestrator extension (Python)

The orchestrator gains a `Phase8DominionRuntime` helper that reads the manifest, scores domains, tracks sentinel coverage, and
annotates every step with governance guardrails. This powers non-technical users: they simply point the orchestrator at the JSON
snapshot and receive autonomous routing with human-readable rationales.

---

## ✅ Ready for Universal Value Dominance

* Governance owns every parameter, stream, sentinel, and pause lever.
* Telemetry, calldata, UI, and guardrails are generated via two npm commands.
* CI blocks merges without a validated manifest and UI surface.
* Non-technical operators can command the Phase 8 economy using only this directory.
