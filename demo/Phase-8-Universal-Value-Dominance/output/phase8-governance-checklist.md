> This briefing converts the encoded calldata manifest into a guardian flight plan so non-technical operators can command the universal value mesh with total confidence.

- Manager Safe / Timelock: `0xfa12b3c4d5e6f7890abcdeffedcba98765432109`
- Chain ID: 1
- Universal dominance score: 97.1 / 100
- Guardian lattice coverage: 45.0 min (minimum adequacy 125.0%)
- Capital floor: $720.00B / yr per dominion (100% funded coverage)

## Execution order
1. **Prime global parameters**
   - Commit treasury, vault, upgrade, validator, mission control, and knowledge graph endpoints alongside heartbeat, review window, drawdown guard, and manifesto URI.
   - Encoded calls: 1
   - Verification: Cross-check every address against the guardian roster and confirm the manifesto hash matches the signed directive before execution.
   - Note: This call unlocks the rest of the run — treat it as the canonical source of truth for the superintelligence's operating map.
2. **Authorize guardian council multisig**
   - Hands the emergency override lever to the council so human governance can veto or pause any subsystem within minutes.
   - Encoded calls: 1
   - Verification: Confirm quorum participants are online and that timelock policies (if any) reflect the latest governance resolution.
3. **Wire emergency pause relay**
   - Routes forwardPauseCall payloads to the SystemPause contract, ensuring circuit breakers halt or resume every module instantly.
   - Encoded calls: 1
   - Verification: Validate the pause contract address on-chain and confirm guardians rehearsed the pause/unpause sequence with this target.
4. **Activate dominion orchestrators**
   - Registers each value domain with orchestrator, validator, policy kernel, heartbeat, TVL cap, and autonomy guardrails.
   - Targets: climate-harmonizer — Climate Harmonizer Array · health-sovereign — Health Sovereign Continuum · infrastructure-synthesis — Infrastructure Synthesis Grid · knowledge-lattice — Knowledge Lattice Nexus · planetary-finance — Planetary Finance Mesh
   - Encoded calls: 5
   - Verification: Compare autonomy bps, heartbeat seconds, and vault limits with the manifest briefing for each domain before confirming.
5. **Bind sentinel coverage**
   - Links each sentinel to the domains it must supervise, enforcing lattice coverage guarantees over the economy.
   - Targets: bio-sentinel — Bio Sentinel Continuity · capital-watch — Capital Watch Exocomptroller · solar-shield — Solar Shield Guardian
   - Encoded calls: 3
   - Verification: Ensure every domain slug listed here is covered ≥ guardian review window seconds and aligns with the telemetry report.
6. **Commission sentinel agents**
   - Authorizes watchdog agents with coverage cadences, sensitivity thresholds, and policy URIs so anomalies trigger guardians immediately.
   - Targets: bio-sentinel — Bio Sentinel Continuity · capital-watch — Capital Watch Exocomptroller · solar-shield — Solar Shield Guardian
   - Encoded calls: 3
   - Verification: Confirm agent addresses correspond to deployed sentinel contracts and that sensitivity bps matches guardian expectations.
7. **Spin up capital conduits**
   - Allocates annual budgets and expansion curves that fund the dominions autonomously via dedicated vaults.
   - Targets: climate-stabilization — Climate Stabilization Endowment · innovation-thrust — Innovation Thrust Catalyst · planetary-resilience — Planetary Resilience Fund
   - Encoded calls: 3
   - Verification: Verify annual budget totals sum to the treasury directive and that vault addresses have multisig control or timelock protections.
8. **Aim capital flows**
   - Targets each capital stream at specific dominions so funding ratios stay synchronized with resilience and performance signals.
   - Targets: climate-stabilization — Climate Stabilization Endowment · innovation-thrust — Innovation Thrust Catalyst · planetary-resilience — Planetary Resilience Fund
   - Encoded calls: 3
   - Verification: Confirm every funded domain matches the cycle report ledger and that no required dominion is omitted.
9. **Publish self-improvement plan**
   - Updates cadence, checksum, and URI for the automated upgrade charter governing the self-improvement kernel.
   - Encoded calls: 1
   - Verification: Have guardians re-hash the payload locally and ensure cadence seconds honour human override windows before committing.
10. **Record latest improvement cycle**
   - Appends timestamp + report URI so every retraining run is immutably logged for auditors and mission control.
   - Encoded calls: 1
   - Verification: Confirm the referenced report is uploaded (IPFS or archive) and that the timestamp reflects finalized evaluation sign-off.
11. **Teardown dominions (optional)**
   - Removes legacy dominions from the registry when decommissioning or rotating orchestrators.
   - Targets: climate-harmonizer — Climate Harmonizer Array · health-sovereign — Health Sovereign Continuum · infrastructure-synthesis — Infrastructure Synthesis Grid · knowledge-lattice — Knowledge Lattice Nexus · planetary-finance — Planetary Finance Mesh
   - Encoded calls: 5
   - Verification: Only execute after capital streams are retargeted and sentinel coverage migrates — document rationale in guardian minutes.
12. **Decommission sentinels (optional)**
   - Clears sentinel agents from the lattice once replacements are confirmed or coverage is rebalanced.
   - Targets: bio-sentinel — Bio Sentinel Continuity · capital-watch — Capital Watch Exocomptroller · solar-shield — Solar Shield Guardian
   - Encoded calls: 3
   - Verification: Ensure a successor sentinel already covers the affected dominions so coverage adequacy never drops below 100%.
13. **Retire capital streams (optional)**
   - Stops legacy funding programs once treasuries are merged or mandates expire.
   - Targets: climate-stabilization — Climate Stabilization Endowment · innovation-thrust — Innovation Thrust Catalyst · planetary-resilience — Planetary Resilience Fund
   - Encoded calls: 3
   - Verification: Validate that remaining streams keep every dominion at or above the mandated funding floor before removal.

## Pre-flight checks
- Circulate `phase8-governance-directives.md` for guardian signatures.
- Import `phase8-safe-transaction-batch.json` into the Safe or timelock and map steps to this checklist.
- Verify pause coverage using `phase8-emergency-overrides.json` in case guardians need the circuit breaker mid-flight.
- Present the dominance scorecard to stakeholders to confirm readiness metrics remain ≥ guardrail thresholds.

## Post-execution confirmation
- Rerun `npm run demo:phase8:orchestrate` to refresh telemetry and validate no drift across manifest + scorecard.
- Publish the updated self-improvement plan hash and cadence to mission control.
- Archive Safe transaction receipts with this checklist for audit trails — this forms the human verification layer for the superintelligence.

> When every checkbox above is satisfied, guardians have mathematically verified control over the superintelligence — universal value dominance with human override dials intact.
