# Phase 8 — Guardian Response Playbook
Generated: 2025-10-25T13:09:58.291Z

## Protocol posture
- Protocols defined: 3
- Domain coverage: 100.0% of domains secured by response plans
- Average severity posture: CRITICAL (0.92)
- Guardian review window: 720s with minimum sentinel coverage 900s

## Scenario 1 — Sentinel outage across climate lattice
- Severity: CRITICAL — immediate guardian intervention
- Trigger condition: Solar Shield guardian misses 2 heartbeats or coverage < 85% of guardian window
- Guardian coverage: Solar Shield Guardian
- Impacted domains: Climate Harmonizer Array · Infrastructure Synthesis Grid

### Immediate actions
1. Execute forwardPauseCall(pauseAll) for climate-harmonizer and infrastructure-synthesis payloads
2. Route remaining geoengineering requests to validator registry for manual approval
3. Escalate to guardian council with telemetry bundle and last known coverage snapshot

### Stabilization actions
1. Re-deploy Solar Shield guardian or spin up hot-standby sentinel with identical policy URI
2. Run Universal Value Mesh Stress Tests playbook to validate resumed coverage
3. Lift pauses sequentially once 3 consecutive coverage intervals exceed guardian window

### Communications
- Notify mission control and climate sovereign working group of pause activation
- Publish incident digest to knowledge lattice for postmortem archiving
- Ping validator registry to increase sampling cadence to every 5 minutes until recovery

### Success criteria
- Sentinel coverage restored ≥ guardian window for two consecutive cycles
- No pending geoengineering jobs without validator approval
- Guardian council sign-off recorded in governance directives log

## Scenario 2 — Capital drawdown breach
- Severity: HIGH — act within guardian review window
- Trigger condition: Capital Watch Exocomptroller flags drawdown > maxDrawdownBps or funded ratio < 95%
- Guardian coverage: Capital Watch Exocomptroller
- Impacted domains: Planetary Finance Mesh · Knowledge Lattice Nexus

### Immediate actions
1. Throttle capital stream disbursements to affected domains via emergency overrides pack
2. Call setRiskParameters with temporary drawdown ceiling 50% of baseline
3. Request validator registry to enforce human sign-off on all treasury outflows

### Stabilization actions
1. Rebalance annual budgets by +5% towards resilience-positive domains
2. Trigger Hyperparameter Evolution playbook focused on capital routing policies
3. Resume normal capital cadence after two audit cycles confirm funded ratio ≥ 100%

### Communications
- Brief treasury stewards with dominance scorecard delta
- Issue Guardian Council notice referencing Safe transaction hashes
- Share funded domain ledger with public oversight channel

### Success criteria
- Funded domain ratio back to 100% for impacted domains
- Drawdown metric stabilized below 0.8 × maxDrawdownBps
- Treasury postmortem logged with knowledge lattice URI

## Scenario 3 — Bio-sentinel anomaly detection
- Severity: CRITICAL — immediate guardian intervention
- Trigger condition: Bio Sentinel Continuity raises sensitivity breach or validator quorum rejects deployment
- Guardian coverage: Bio Sentinel Continuity
- Impacted domains: Health Sovereign Continuum

### Immediate actions
1. Pause Health Sovereign Continuum orchestrator via overrides pack
2. Escalate to guardian council and bioethics board with validator transcripts
3. Switch healthcare deployment queue into human-only review mode

### Stabilization actions
1. Mandate cross-check with Infrastructure Synthesis Grid for supply readiness
2. Run Universal Value Mesh Stress Tests with biosecurity focus
3. Resume automation after guardian council records affirmative restart vote

### Communications
- Notify public health partners through mission control broadcast
- Distribute incident brief via knowledge lattice with anonymized metrics
- Alert validator registry to maintain heightened scrutiny for 48 hours

### Success criteria
- Bio sentinel coverage back to baseline 900s
- All critical deployments receive validator sign-off during incident window
- Guardian council restart authorization logged
