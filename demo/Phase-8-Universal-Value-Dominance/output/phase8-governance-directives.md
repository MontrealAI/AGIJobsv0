## Immediate directives
1. Confirm npm dependencies remain locked via `npm ci` (step enforced by CI).
2. Run `npm run demo:phase8:orchestrate` to regenerate calldata, scorecard, and operator briefings.
3. Load `output/phase8-governance-calldata.json` or `output/phase8-safe-transaction-batch.json` into your multisig / timelock and execute the queued actions in sequence.
4. Distribute `output/phase8-governance-directives.md` and `output/phase8-dominance-scorecard.json` to guardian council and observers for sign-off.
5. Launch the dashboard with `npx serve demo/Phase-8-Universal-Value-Dominance` for live monitoring.

## Safety instrumentation
- Autonomy guard ≤7900 bps · human override 15 minutes · escalation guardian-council → dao-emergency → sentinel-lockdown
- Guardian review window 720s with minimum sentinel coverage 900s (adequacy 125.0%).
- Self-improvement cadence 2.00 h · last execution 2023-11-14T22:20:00.000Z.
- Kernel checksum sha3-256 0xf37c9df49d3b7b2b40fd1c7ed49f59f450e8e6afc3d93f0a1d7c5e3ab4f2c1d0
- Kernel zk-proof phase8-alignment-v1 :: status pending :: artifact ipfs://agi-jobs/phase8/self-improvement/zk-proof-placeholder.json

## Reporting & distribution
- Share the dominance scorecard (JSON) with analytics teams for downstream automation.
- Provide the orchestration report and directives markdown to auditors for immutable records.
- Archive the telemetry markdown for board-level status updates.
