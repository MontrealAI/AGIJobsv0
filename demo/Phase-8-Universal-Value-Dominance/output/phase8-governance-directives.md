# Phase 8 — Governance Directives
Generated: 2025-10-25T00:44:27.944Z
Chain ID: 1
Phase8 manager: Set PHASE8_MANAGER_ADDRESS before submitting calls

## Immediate directives
1. Confirm npm dependencies remain locked via `npm ci` (step enforced by CI).
2. Run `npm run demo:phase8:orchestrate` to regenerate calldata, scorecard, and operator briefings.
3. Load `output/phase8-governance-calldata.json` or `output/phase8-safe-transaction-batch.json` into your multisig / timelock and execute the queued actions in sequence.
4. Distribute `output/phase8-governance-directives.md` and `output/phase8-dominance-scorecard.json` to guardian council and observers for sign-off.
5. Launch the dashboard with `npx serve demo/Phase-8-Universal-Value-Dominance` for live monitoring.
6. Deliver `output/phase8-emergency-playbook.md` to guardian response leads so pause instructions are at hand.

## Oversight priorities
- Planetary Finance Mesh: resilience 0.960, autonomy 7800 bps, coverage 900s (125.0% of guardian window), funding $890.00B/yr, sentinels Capital Watch Exocomptroller, streams Planetary Resilience Fund
- Climate Harmonizer Array: resilience 0.940, autonomy 7400 bps, coverage 900s (125.0% of guardian window), funding $720.00B/yr, sentinels Solar Shield Guardian, streams Climate Stabilization Endowment
- Health Sovereign Continuum: resilience 0.910, autonomy 7000 bps, coverage 900s (125.0% of guardian window), funding $890.00B/yr, sentinels Bio Sentinel Continuity, streams Planetary Resilience Fund
- Infrastructure Synthesis Grid: resilience 0.915, autonomy 7600 bps, coverage 900s (125.0% of guardian window), funding $1.08T/yr, sentinels Solar Shield Guardian, streams Climate Stabilization Endowment · Innovation Thrust Catalyst
- Knowledge Lattice Nexus: resilience 0.902, autonomy 6900 bps, coverage 900s (125.0% of guardian window), funding $1.25T/yr, sentinels Capital Watch Exocomptroller, streams Planetary Resilience Fund · Innovation Thrust Catalyst

## Safety instrumentation
- Autonomy guard ≤7900 bps · human override 15 minutes · escalation guardian-council → dao-emergency → sentinel-lockdown
- Guardian review window 720s with minimum sentinel coverage 900s (adequacy 125.0%).
- Self-improvement cadence 2.00 h · last execution 2023-11-14T22:20:00.000Z.
- Kernel checksum sha3-256 0xf37c9df49d3b7b2b40fd1c7ed49f59f450e8e6afc3d93f0a1d7c5e3ab4f2c1d0
- Kernel zk-proof phase8-alignment-v1 :: status pending :: artifact ipfs://agi-jobs/phase8/self-improvement/zk-proof-placeholder.json
- Emergency protocols 2/3 routed through system pause · fastest reaction immediate.

## Emergency response protocols
- Guardian Council · Superpause: trigger → Any sentinel escalates to critical severity or drawdown exceeds the maxDrawdown guard.; action → Submit forwardPauseCall(systemPause, pauseAll()) via the Phase8 manager to freeze every module instantly.; reaction 0s; authority 0x4c3ab8173d97d58b0daa9f73a2e3e87a4fe98c87; targets all.
- Domain Isolation · Planetary Finance: trigger → Planetary Finance Mesh sentinel emits anomaly > 400 bps or TVL drawdown breaches 20%.; action → Call forwardPauseCall(systemPause, pauseDomain(keccak256("planetary-finance"))) to isolate the domain.; reaction 900s; authority 0x4c3ab8173d97d58b0daa9f73a2e3e87a4fe98c87; targets planetary-finance.
- Capital Stream Freeze · Planetary Resilience Fund: trigger → Guardian Council vote to redirect treasury following sentinel misuse report or policy shift.; action → Invoke setCapitalStreamActive(planetary-resilience, false) then forwardPauseCall for dependent domains.; reaction 3600s; authority 0x4c3ab8173d97d58b0daa9f73a2e3e87a4fe98c87; targets planetary-finance, health-sovereign, knowledge-lattice.

## Reporting & distribution
- Share the dominance scorecard (JSON) with analytics teams for downstream automation.
- Provide the orchestration report and directives markdown to auditors for immutable records.
- Archive the telemetry markdown for board-level status updates.
