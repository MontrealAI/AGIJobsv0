## Governance & Human Collaboration
- Governance interface: https://governance.agi.jobs/phase8
- Validator tools: Guardian Console (https://guardian.agi.jobs/phase8), Safe Transaction Builder (https://safe.global/tx-builder)
  • Proposal template Phase 8 parameter refresh: ETA 8h — Updates treasury, sentinel, and autonomy bounds for the next guardian cycle.
  • Proposal template AI team onboarding: ETA 12h — Adds a new specialist guild for emergent economic domains with predefined guardrails.
- Human-in-the-loop controls:
  • Medical domain sign-off: requirement Licensed medical validator must co-sign autonomy above 2 hours for health-sovereign domain. — enforcement Guardian console blocks payout until human signature recorded.
  • Emergency override rehearsal: requirement Guardian council must rehearse full pause/unpause within last 14 days before enabling >5h autonomy. — enforcement Autonomy guard refuses escalation without rehearsal certificate.

## Guardian Response Protocols
- [1] Sentinel outage across climate lattice — CRITICAL — immediate guardian intervention
  • Trigger: Solar Shield guardian misses 2 heartbeats or coverage < 85% of guardian window
  • Guardians: solar-shield
  • Domains: climate-harmonizer, infrastructure-synthesis
  • Immediate actions: Execute forwardPauseCall(pauseAll) for climate-harmonizer and infrastructure-synthesis payloads | Route remaining geoengineering requests to validator registry for manual approval | Escalate to guardian council with telemetry bundle and last known coverage snapshot
  • Stabilization actions: Re-deploy Solar Shield guardian or spin up hot-standby sentinel with identical policy URI | Run Universal Value Mesh Stress Tests playbook to validate resumed coverage | Lift pauses sequentially once 3 consecutive coverage intervals exceed guardian window
  • Communications: Notify mission control and climate sovereign working group of pause activation | Publish incident digest to knowledge lattice for postmortem archiving | Ping validator registry to increase sampling cadence to every 5 minutes until recovery
  • Success criteria: Sentinel coverage restored ≥ guardian window for two consecutive cycles | No pending geoengineering jobs without validator approval | Guardian council sign-off recorded in governance directives log
- [2] Capital drawdown breach — HIGH — act within guardian review window
  • Trigger: Capital Watch Exocomptroller flags drawdown > maxDrawdownBps or funded ratio < 95%
  • Guardians: capital-watch
  • Domains: planetary-finance, knowledge-lattice
  • Immediate actions: Throttle capital stream disbursements to affected domains via emergency overrides pack | Call setRiskParameters with temporary drawdown ceiling 50% of baseline | Request validator registry to enforce human sign-off on all treasury outflows
  • Stabilization actions: Rebalance annual budgets by +5% towards resilience-positive domains | Trigger Hyperparameter Evolution playbook focused on capital routing policies | Resume normal capital cadence after two audit cycles confirm funded ratio ≥ 100%
  • Communications: Brief treasury stewards with dominance scorecard delta | Issue Guardian Council notice referencing Safe transaction hashes | Share funded domain ledger with public oversight channel
  • Success criteria: Funded domain ratio back to 100% for impacted domains | Drawdown metric stabilized below 0.8 × maxDrawdownBps | Treasury postmortem logged with knowledge lattice URI
- [3] Bio-sentinel anomaly detection — CRITICAL — immediate guardian intervention
  • Trigger: Bio Sentinel Continuity raises sensitivity breach or validator quorum rejects deployment
  • Guardians: bio-sentinel
  • Domains: health-sovereign
  • Immediate actions: Pause Health Sovereign Continuum orchestrator via overrides pack | Escalate to guardian council and bioethics board with validator transcripts | Switch healthcare deployment queue into human-only review mode
  • Stabilization actions: Mandate cross-check with Infrastructure Synthesis Grid for supply readiness | Run Universal Value Mesh Stress Tests with biosecurity focus | Resume automation after guardian council records affirmative restart vote
  • Communications: Notify public health partners through mission control broadcast | Distribute incident brief via knowledge lattice with anonymized metrics | Alert validator registry to maintain heightened scrutiny for 48 hours
  • Success criteria: Bio sentinel coverage back to baseline 900s | All critical deployments receive validator sign-off during incident window | Guardian council restart authorization logged
