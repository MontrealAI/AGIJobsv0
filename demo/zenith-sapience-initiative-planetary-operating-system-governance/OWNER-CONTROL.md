# Zenith Sapience Planetary Operating System â€“ Owner Control Matrix

The AGI Jobs v0 (v2) contracts remain entirely owner-driven. This dossier enumerates every control lever required for the **Zenith Sapience Planetary Operating System** demonstration and links each lever to the existing repository scripts.

---

## 1. Governance Authorities

| Capability | Contract / Script | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Global pause / resume | `SystemPause` via `npm run owner:system-pause` | Immediately halts or resumes all marketplace activity. Requires owner/multisig signatures. |
| Treasury management | `StakeManager`, `JobRegistry`, `RewardEngineMB` via Hardhat tasks | Owner adjusts treasury addresses, reward splits, and slashing parameters. |
| Policy updates | `AGIGovernor` timelock | Proposals queued through quadratic voting with a 7-day delay. |
| Identity enforcement | `IdentityRegistry` via `npm run owner:identity-registry` | Register, update, or revoke ENS-bound identities for agents and validators. |
| Thermostat steering | `scripts/v2/updateThermodynamics.ts` | Adjusts incentive temperatures and validator/agent splits per epoch. |

---

## 2. Parameter Adjustment Workflow

1. Review the latest `reports/zenith-planetary-os/parameter-matrix.md`.
2. Draft changes and capture multisig approvals.
3. Apply updates using:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/v2/updateThermodynamics.ts --network <target>
   ```
4. Confirm the resulting deltas in `thermodynamics.json`.
5. Regenerate dashboards:
   ```bash
   npm run owner:parameters -- --network <target> --format markdown --out reports/zenith-planetary-os/parameter-matrix.md
   npm run owner:mission-control -- --network <target> --format markdown --out reports/zenith-planetary-os/mission-control.md --bundle reports/zenith-planetary-os/mission-bundle
   ```
6. Archive artefacts and distribute to stakeholders.

---

## 3. Emergency Pause Runbook

1. Execute `npm run owner:system-pause -- --network <target> --action pause`.
2. Ensure `mission-control.md` reflects `status: paused`.
3. Broadcast pause confirmation to all agent operators.
4. Investigate incident; apply fixes via governance proposals or direct owner calls as appropriate.
5. Resume by executing `npm run owner:system-pause -- --network <target> --action unpause`.
6. Capture the event timeline with `npm run owner:command-center -- --network <target> --format markdown --out reports/zenith-planetary-os/command-center.md`.

---

## 4. Identity & Role Management

- All actors must hold ENS subdomains (e.g., `zenith.os.orchestrator.world.agi.eth`).
- Use `npm run owner:identity-registry -- --network <target> --list` to audit current registry entries.
- To onboard a new agent or validator:
  1. Register the ENS name.
  2. Execute `npm run owner:identity-registry -- --network <target> --set <ens> <address> <role>`.
  3. Update the relevant section of `project-plan.json` and circulate to stakeholders.
- To revoke access: call the same script with `--clear` and ensure the change is mirrored in mission dashboards.

---

## 5. Treasury & Budget Oversight

- Budget allocations are defined in `project-plan.json`. Changes require council approval.
- Treasury address overrides are performed via Hardhat tasks in `scripts/v2`. Use `npx hardhat run scripts/v2/setTreasury.ts --network <target> --treasury <address>` when re-pointing the treasury.
- For slashing or reward adjustments, operate `RewardEngineMB` functions via the provided CLI wrappers or Hardhat scripts. Document every change in `command-center.md`.

---

## 6. Timelock Governance Operations

- Proposals are constructed off-chain, then submitted with the `AGIGovernor` front-end or CLI.
- Required quorum: 23% of total voting power.
- Proposal threshold: 1,750,000 $AGIALPHA equivalent.
- Execution delay: 7 days. During this window, the SystemPause remains available for emergency intervention.
- Post-execution, regenerate `mission-control.md` and `summary.md` to capture the new system state.

---

## 7. Compliance & Audit Trail

- Ensure every owner action is reflected in `command-center.md`. The deterministic demo scripts append entries when they detect owner CLI invocations.
- Hash artefacts (`summary.md`, `mission-control.md`, `thermodynamics.json`) using `npm run audit:hash -- reports/zenith-planetary-os` and store hashes on-chain or in the audit ledger.
- Review the GitHub Actions artefacts from `.github/workflows/demo-zenith-sapience-planetary-os.yml` for immutable CI traces.

With these controls, the owner maintains absolute authority over the Zenith Sapience Planetary Operating System while benefiting from the autonomous intelligence of the AGI Jobs v0 (v2) stack.
