## Sequencer programme
- Operator: AGI Jobs Sequencer Syndicate
- Backups: Sovereign Mesh Collective, Atlas Sentinel Grid
- Decentralisation plan: Progressively activate additional sequencer keys via governance, rotating keys each epoch with automated proof verification.

## Guardrails
- Run bridge settlement verification every epoch and attest results to governance ledger.
- Hold >= 110% liquidity buffer in the mainnet treasury for L2 settlement backstops.
- Trigger sequencer key rotation if latency exceeds 90th percentile for 15 minutes.
- Escalate to governance safe if bridge watchers report anomaly severity > 2.

## Playbooks
- **Bridge emergency pause** — `npm run owner:program -- --program bridge-emergency-pause` (Pause rollup bridge on anomaly and route settlements back to mainnet.)
- **Sequencer failover** — `npm run owner:program -- --program sequencer-failover` (Rotate sequencer key set via multi-sig and resynchronise watchers.)
- **L2 liquidity top-up** — `npm run owner:program -- --program treasury-l2-topup` (Refill bridge liquidity from mainnet treasury buffers when utilisation > 80%.)

## Readiness factors
| Factor | Weight | Contribution | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bridge audit coverage | 25.0% | 25.0% | COMPLETE | Latest bridge audit completed Jan 2025 by Sigma Prime with zero critical findings. |
| Sequencer failover drills | 20.0% | 12.0% | IN-PROGRESS | Quarterly rotation drills underway; 3 of 4 rehearsals executed with validated proofs. |
| Data availability pipeline | 20.0% | 20.0% | COMPLETE | EigenDA service level integrated with redundancy mirrors across three geographies. |
| Liquidity backstop | 15.0% | 15.0% | COMPLETE | Mainnet treasury commits 15M AGI liquidity buffer with automated refill triggers. |
| Compliance protocol | 10.0% | 10.0% | COMPLETE | Jurisdictional review complete; attestations logged on-chain for regulator portal. |
| Agent migration mesh | 10.0% | 6.0% | IN-PROGRESS | Agent gateway beta routed 72% of workloads through Arbitrum mirrored APIs. |

## Recommended actions
- Complete readiness factor: Sequencer failover drills.
- Complete readiness factor: Agent migration mesh.

_Commentary:_ Layer-2 mesh ready for production pilot with bridge guardrails, sequencer rotations, and compliance telemetry wired into the owner autopilot.
