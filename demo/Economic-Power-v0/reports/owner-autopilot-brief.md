# Economic Power Autopilot Brief

Scenario: AGIJobs Economic Power Launch (economic-power-v0-baseline)
Mission: Sustain unstoppable economic acceleration with deterministic owner oversight.

Cadence: 6.7h • Dominance 99.4% (total-dominion)
Control coverage: 100.0% — Owner multi-sig holds deterministic runbooks for every critical surface.
Safety mesh score: 97.9% • Custody: 100.0%
Owner multi-sig exerts absolute dominion – every command, pause, and upgrade is scripted and rehearsed.

## Guardrails
- Pause • npm run owner:system-pause
- Resume • npm run owner:update-all
- validatorConfidence < 0.95 → npm run owner:system-pause
- automationScore < 0.8 → npm run owner:parameters
- treasuryAfterRun < 1800000 → npm run owner:audit
- Control drills 100.0% (total-control)

## Command sequence
1. [JOBS] npm run owner:program -- --program job-ai-lab-fusion — Dispatch Helios and Atlas to fuse AI labs into a consolidated planetary accelerator.
2. [JOBS] npm run owner:program -- --program job-supply-chain — Reconfigure autonomous supply mesh coverage for instant cross-border fulfilment.
3. [VALIDATORS] npm run owner:program -- --program validator-alpha — Escalate Validator Alpha quorum weighting and deploy fresh attestations.
4. [VALIDATORS] npm run owner:program -- --program validator-beta — Rotate Validator Beta committees and enforce staking deltas.
5. [STABLECOINADAPTERS] npm run owner:program -- --program adapter-usdc — Upgrade the USDC bridge adapter with deterministic slippage guards.
6. [MODULES] npm run owner:program -- --program module-job-registry — Promote the JobRegistry v2 deployment with zero-downtime migration.
7. [MODULES] npm run owner:program -- --program module-stake-manager — Adjust stake thresholds and payout cadence for StakeManager.
8. [TREASURY] npm run owner:program -- --program treasury-liquidity — Rebalance AGI/USDC buffers and top up validator incentive pools.
9. [TREASURY] npm run owner:program -- --program treasury-yield — Deploy surplus treasury capital into protocol-aligned yield strategies.
10. [ORCHESTRATOR] npm run owner:program -- --program orchestrator-rebalance — Re-weight autonomous routing priorities to maximise throughput.
11. [ORCHESTRATOR] npm run owner:program -- --program orchestrator-pause-drill — Run full-stack pause/resume drill to validate emergency readiness.
