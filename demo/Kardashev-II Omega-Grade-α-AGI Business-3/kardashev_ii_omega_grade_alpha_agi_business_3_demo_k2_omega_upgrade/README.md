# AGI Jobs v0 (v2) — Demo → Kardashev II Omega Grade α AGI Business 3 → Kardashev II Omega Grade Alpha AGI Business 3 Demo K2 Omega Upgrade

> AGI Jobs v0 (v2) is our sovereign intelligence engine; this module extends that superintelligent machine with specialised capabilities for `demo/Kardashev-II Omega-Grade-α-AGI Business-3/kardashev_ii_omega_grade_alpha_agi_business_3_demo_k2_omega_upgrade`.

## Overview
- **Path:** `demo/Kardashev-II Omega-Grade-α-AGI Business-3/kardashev_ii_omega_grade_alpha_agi_business_3_demo_k2_omega_upgrade/README.md`
- **Module Focus:** Anchors Demo → Kardashev II Omega Grade α AGI Business 3 → Kardashev II Omega Grade Alpha AGI Business 3 Demo K2 Omega Upgrade inside the AGI Jobs v0 (v2) lattice so teams can orchestrate economic, governance, and operational missions with deterministic guardrails.
- **Integration Role:** Interfaces with the unified owner control plane, telemetry mesh, and contract registry to deliver end-to-end resilience.

## Capabilities
- Provides opinionated configuration and assets tailored to `demo/Kardashev-II Omega-Grade-α-AGI Business-3/kardashev_ii_omega_grade_alpha_agi_business_3_demo_k2_omega_upgrade` while remaining interoperable with the global AGI Jobs v0 (v2) runtime.
- Ships with safety-first defaults so non-technical operators can activate the experience without compromising security or compliance.
- Publishes ready-to-automate hooks for CI, observability, and ledger reconciliation.
