# Infinity Symphony — Planetary Coordination Orchestrator

> _"An economy-scale intelligence lattice that feels inevitable."_

**Infinity Symphony** is the flagship AGI Jobs v0 (v2) take-off demonstration at the nexus of global coordination, decentralized governance, and thermodynamic economic planning. It stages a civilisation-scale launch drill without adding any new runtime primitives: every capability comes directly from the existing AGI Jobs repository. The result is a CI-ready artefact pack that behaves like the intelligence engine capable of reshaping world order.

## Why Infinity Symphony

- **Beyond-national choreography.** Five continental blocs, twelve critical infrastructure programs, and three planetary emergencies are steered in a single deterministic mission loop using `scripts/v2/asiTakeoffDemo.ts` and the mission planners already in the repo.
- **Entirely automatable.** Bash/Make harnesses in this folder wrap canonical npm scripts (`demo:asi-takeoff`, `owner:command-center`, `owner:atlas`, `owner:mission-control`, `demo:aurora:report`) so CI systems reproduce the same receipts, governance bundles, and diagrams without manual input.
- **Mainnet-proxied.** Mission specs, thermostat matrices, and owner control overlays target the mainnet configuration schemas under `config/`, assuming access to production-grade block space, state, and observability.
- **Audit-grade reporting.** Generated artefacts include Markdown dossiers, parameter matrices, thermal telemetry, cryptographic fingerprints, and flows ready for ENS publication or IPFS pinning.

## Multi-Phase Mission Narrative

1. **Planetary charter ingestion.** `project-plan.json` feeds the dry-run harness via `ASI_TAKEOFF_PLAN_PATH`, seeding job dependencies, budgets, and thermodynamic triggers across continents.
2. **Sectorial mission weaving.** `mission@v2.json` loads four mission specs into the AURORA orchestrator, aligning agriculture, infrastructure, emergency, and trade programs into a singular labour market.
3. **Thermostatic steering.** `infinity-symphony.thermostat@v2.json` overlays entropy floors, validator bonuses, and panic triggers, enabling automatic heat-shifting when latency or disputes spike.
4. **Command fabric synthesis.** Owner dashboards (`owner:atlas`, `owner:command-center`, `owner:mission-control`) regenerate control proofs, parameter matrices, and mermaid diagrams anchored to the existing config directory.
5. **Publication + audit trail.** `bin/infinity-symphony-local.sh` captures all receipts, replicates them into `reports/<network>/infinity-symphony`, and renders the mission compendium, ready for CI artefacts or mainnet broadcast.

## CI Integration Template

Add the following job to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (or an equivalent pipeline) to reproduce the demonstration on every commit:

```
- name: Infinity Symphony
  run: |
    export ASI_TAKEOFF_PLAN_PATH=demo/infinity-symphony/project-plan.json
    bash demo/infinity-symphony/bin/infinity-symphony-local.sh --ci
  env:
    NETWORK: localhost
    AURORA_REPORT_SCOPE: infinity-symphony
    AURORA_MISSION_CONFIG: demo/infinity-symphony/config/mission@v2.json
    AURORA_THERMOSTAT_CONFIG: demo/infinity-symphony/config/infinity-symphony.thermostat@v2.json
    AURORA_REPORT_TITLE: "Infinity Symphony — Planetary Mission Report"
```

The script is idempotent: rerunning it overwrites artefacts deterministically, producing auditable SHA-256 manifests under `reports/localhost/infinity-symphony`.

## Extending the Demonstration

- Point `ASI_TAKEOFF_PLAN_PATH` at `project-plan.worldfood.json` (to be authored by your team) to simulate agricultural surge scenarios.
- Swap `NETWORK=sepolia` to replay on AGI Jobs' staging deployment without modifying the scripts.
- Feed the generated artefacts into `scripts/v2/owner:snapshot` for immutable archives or into the attestation service under `attestation/eas`.

## Deterministic Outputs

Running `bin/infinity-symphony-local.sh` yields:

- `reports/localhost/infinity-symphony/receipts/` — mission, deploy, stake, governance logs.
- `reports/localhost/infinity-symphony/infinity-symphony-report.md` — consolidated mission compendium with diagrams embedded.
- `reports/localhost/infinity-symphony/governance/` — Atlas, command center, mission control, thermostat matrix.
- `reports/asi-takeoff/` — raw dry-run bundle preserved for regression diffing.

Every artefact is reproducible on CI, enabling sovereign operators to prove control, economic stability, and coordination readiness without writing new code.
