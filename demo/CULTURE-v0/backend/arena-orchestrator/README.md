# Arena Orchestrator Skeleton

This directory will house the TypeScript orchestrator that automates teacher → student → critic self-play loops. The sprint playbook outlines modules (`arena.service.ts`, `difficulty.ts`, `elo.ts`, `qd.ts`, `ipfs.ts`, `agijobs.ts`) and accompanying tests. Implementation pending execution of tickets AO-01 through AO-03.
