# CULTURE Demo Scripts Roadmap

Scripts to be implemented during the sprint:
- `deploy.culture.ts`: Deploys CultureRegistry & SelfPlayArena contracts with owner configuration.
- `seed.culture.ts`: Registers canonical agent identities, seeds sample artifacts, and initializes difficulty baselines.
- `run.arena.sample.ts`: Executes an end-to-end dry-run round against mocked agents for regression tests.

Each script will include argument validation, dry-run mode, and verbose logging consistent with the runbook.
