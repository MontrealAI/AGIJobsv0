# Meta-Agentic α-AGI Jobs Demo V8 — Meta-Convergence Console

V8 upgrades the Meta-Agentic showcase into the **Meta-Convergence Console**:

- Meta-agentic flywheel that fuses identify→learn→think→design→strategise→execute while
  continuously validating CI, antifragility buffers, unstoppable reserves, and guardian readiness.
- Sovereign owner mandate with fully mutable parameters (fees, validator bonds, alpha multipliers),
  hot-swappable control scripts, timelock + multisig guardrails, and delegated override lanes.
- Autonomous treasury dominion with ≥42% unstoppable reserves, ≥44% antifragility buffers, and
  convergence-aware liquidity routing energising the capital flywheel.
- Pre-generated UI + artefact suite (Mermaid flow, journey, quadrant, and mindmap diagrams) designed
  so non-technical owners can relaunch, tweak YAML, and receive an updated console in seconds.

Run via:

```bash
python demo/Meta-Agentic-ALPHA-AGI-Jobs-v0/meta_agentic_demo_v8.py
```

All artefacts are emitted to `meta_agentic_alpha_v8/ui` and `meta_agentic_alpha_v8/reports/generated`.
