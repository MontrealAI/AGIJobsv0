# Meta-Agentic α-Convergence Overview

Meta-Convergence V8 demonstrates how AGI Jobs v0 (v2) grants a non-technical owner
full command over a sovereign alpha factory:

- **Identify → Execute flywheel** with AI-driven signal fusion, planning, design,
  treasury domination, and automated on-chain execution.
- **Owner sovereignty lattice** – session keys, multisig, timelock, and scriptable
  overrides keep the owner in charge at every step.
- **Capital flywheel diagnostics** – unstoppable reserves at 42%, antifragility
  buffers at 44%, and CI-enforced 4337 pipelines.
- **Generated artefacts** – dashboards, mermaid diagrams, reports, and control
  surfaces update automatically whenever the scenario YAML changes.
