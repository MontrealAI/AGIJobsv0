# Meta-Agentic α-AGI Jobs V9 — Sovereignty Overview

The Sovereignty Console is generated entirely by AGI Jobs v0 (v2). A single
command from a non-technical owner deploys the full identify→learn→think→design→
strategise→execute continuum with unstoppable guard rails.

## Highlights

- **Owner-first orchestration:** Timelock + multisig + guardian quorum with
  break-glass overrides and unstoppable threshold at 94%.
- **Meta-agentic intelligence:** Mission threads spawn autonomously across
  treasury, guardians, execution, and curriculum domains.
- **Account abstraction:** ERC-4337 bundler + sovereign paymaster deliver
  gasless execution with eight session keys and rotation automation.
- **Antifragility reserves:** 48% unstoppable reserve, 46% antifragility buffer,
  continuous liquidity streams, and autopilot rebalance scripts.
- **CI V2 enforcement:** pytest, orchestrator-ci, foundry, static analysis,
  fuzzing, scorecard, and governance invariants all verified before execution.

## Run Flow

1. Owner launches `meta_agentic_demo_v9.py`.
2. Scenario YAML validated for unstoppable sovereignty requirements.
3. Meta-agentic planner generates the mission lattice and dry-run envelope.
4. ERC-4337 simulation confirms execution routes and paymaster coverage.
5. Guardian mesh validates antifragility and approves unstoppable threshold.
6. Sovereignty dashboard + masterplan deck generated automatically.
7. Owner can activate override scripts, adjust parameters, or pause instantly.

## Artefacts

- `storage/latest_run_v9.json` — full orchestration payload.
- `meta_agentic_alpha_v9/ui/index.html` — Sovereignty Console UI.
- `meta_agentic_alpha_v9/ui/dashboard-data-v9.json` — auto-generated telemetry.
- `meta_agentic_alpha_v9/reports/generated/alpha_meta_sovereignty_masterplan.md`
  — masterplan deck with Mermaid diagrams and scoreboard snapshot.

Update any configuration or parameter and rerun the CLI: the entire stack
rebuilds itself, demonstrating how AGI Jobs v0 (v2) empowers owners to command a
superintelligent economic engine.
