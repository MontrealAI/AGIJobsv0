  name: "Meta-Agentic α-AGI Jobs Demo V11 — Hypergrid"
  narrative: |
    A non-technical sovereign owner launches the Hypergrid Console. AGI Jobs v0 (v2)
    spins up a full-stack meta-agentic alpha factory: multi-domain signal sweeps,
    self-escalating curriculum, tree-search meta-planning, antifragility design,
    sovereign strategy governance, unstoppable execution meshes, and ERC-4337
    automation. Every artefact is generated from one YAML—no manual wiring.

  narrative: |
    The Hypergrid scenario operationalises the Meta-Agentic sprint plan. Signals are
    ingested across finance, supply chains, research, and policy; MuZero-grade world
    models learn continuously; a meta-agentic tree search coordinates specialist
    agents; creative design studios iterate via simulation feedback; the sovereign
    strategist balances capital and ethics; and an unstoppable execution mesh
    performs on-chain actions with ERC-4337 account abstraction.
