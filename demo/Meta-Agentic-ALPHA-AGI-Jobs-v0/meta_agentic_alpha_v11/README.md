# Meta-Agentic α-AGI Jobs Demo V11 — Hypergrid Console

V11 introduces the **Hypergrid Console**: an owner-only cockpit that proves a
non-technical steward can wield AGI Jobs v0 (v2) to orchestrate a meta-agentic
wealth engine across every phase of the sprint plan:

- **Identify** multi-domain alpha streams with anomaly sentinels and guardian
  telemetry baked into the flow.
- **Out-Learn** via open-ended curricula, MuZero-grade world models, and
  self-escalating simulation channels.
- **Out-Think** using meta-agentic tree search, A2A coordination, and hybrid LLM
  reasoning lattices.
- **Out-Design** with creative synthesis studios that ship antifragility-tested
  blueprints automatically.
- **Out-Strategise** by balancing capital, governance, and ethics via
  owner-governed levers and on-chain guardrails.
- **Out-Execute** through ERC-4337 dry runs, unstoppable execution meshes, and a
  complete Sovereignty Matrix of override switches.

Every artefact—dashboard, masterplan deck, telemetry JSON, and scoreboard—is
regenerated from a single scenario YAML. The owner can update any parameter with
zero code, re-run the CLI, and the hypergrid console refreshes instantly.

## Run the Demo

```bash
python demo/Meta-Agentic-ALPHA-AGI-Jobs-v0/meta_agentic_demo_v11.py
```

Key outputs:

- `storage/latest_run_v11.json`
- `meta_agentic_alpha_v11/ui/index.html`
- `meta_agentic_alpha_v11/ui/dashboard-data-v11.json`
- `meta_agentic_alpha_v11/reports/generated/alpha_meta_singularity_masterplan.md`

Tweak `meta_agentic_alpha_v11/config/scenario.yaml`, rerun the CLI, and the
Hypergrid Console rebuilds itself—complete with Mermaid diagrams, CI V2
verification, and unstoppable owner controls.
