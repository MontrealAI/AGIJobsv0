# Meta-Agentic α-AGI Jobs Demo V11 — Hypergrid Overview

The Hypergrid Console shows how a non-technical owner can command an α-AGI wealth
engine entirely through AGI Jobs v0 (v2). Launching `meta_agentic_demo_v11.py`
instantly orchestrates the full sprint plan:

- **Identify** — Multi-domain anomaly harvesters stream finance, supply, research,
  policy, energy, health, and infrastructure signals into a living opportunity
  graph watched by guardians.
- **Out-Learn** — POET-style curricula and MuZero world models escalate
  complexity automatically, feeding the simulation forge with fresh domains.
- **Out-Think** — Meta-agentic tree search, A2A coordination, and hybrid LLM
  reasoning lattice threads break problems into sovereign-sized strategies.
- **Out-Design** — Creative synthesis studios iterate antifragility-tested
  blueprints, prototypes, dashboards, and telemetry without human wiring.
- **Out-Strategise** — The sovereign strategist balances unstoppable reserves,
  guardian governance, regulatory diplomacy, and ethics safeguards in real time.
- **Out-Execute** — ERC-4337 execution meshes run dry-run first, then commit on
  chain under timelock, multisig, and guardian oversight with gasless controls.

Owner supremacy remains absolute:

- Hypergrid Sovereignty Matrix exposes override switches, upgrade scripts,
  mutable parameters, guardian quorum, antifragility buffers, and unstoppable
  reserves in one view.
- Guardian mesh, multisig, timelock, and circuit breakers guarantee the owner can
  pause, resume, refit, or overclock any mission thread instantly.
- CI V2 enforcement, simulations, and antifragility drills are mandatory and
  reported as human-readable artefacts on every run.

The orchestration outputs the Hypergrid Masterplan, dashboard JSON, and
scoreboard payloads—ready for audits, decision memos, or immediate redeployment.
