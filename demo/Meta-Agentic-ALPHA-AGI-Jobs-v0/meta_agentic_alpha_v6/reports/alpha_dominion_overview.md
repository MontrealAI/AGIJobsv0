# Meta-Agentic α-Dominion Overview

This dossier accompanies the α-Dominion orchestration. It highlights:

- **Identify → Execute** loops across finance, biotech, supply, and energy.
- **Guardian mesh** approvals, failover posture, and antifragility drills.
- **Owner levers** for treasury, governance, account abstraction, and emergency action.
- **Simulation envelope** results proving dry-run success prior to any on-chain commit.

All artefacts are generated automatically when the owner runs `meta_agentic_demo_v6.py`.
