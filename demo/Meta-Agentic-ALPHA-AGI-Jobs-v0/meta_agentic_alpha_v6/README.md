# Meta-Agentic α-AGI Jobs Demo V6 — Meta-Dominion

V6 elevates the Meta-Agentic showcase into **Meta-Dominion mode**:

- Autonomous signal fusion across four global domains feeding a compounding alpha engine.
- Guardian mesh with failover sentinels, antifragility drills, and owner-overridable levers.
- Account-abstraction aware execution (bundler + paymaster) with dry-run simulation envelope.
- Owner sovereignty console exporting dashboards, reports, and mermaid-rich artefacts.
