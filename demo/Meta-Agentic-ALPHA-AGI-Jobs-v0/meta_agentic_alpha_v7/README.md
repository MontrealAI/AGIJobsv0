# Meta-Agentic α-AGI Jobs Demo V7 — Meta-Singularity Console

V7 turns the Meta-Agentic showcase into the **Meta-Singularity Console**:

- Hyperstructure planner that synchronises identify→learn→think→design→strategise→execute loops with
  a live CI verdict grid and on-chain simulation envelope.
- Owner sovereignty lattice with **full parameter overrides** (fees, validator bonds, alpha multipliers),
  rapid pause/resume scripts, and timelock + multisig safeguards wired into every route.
- Autonomous treasury governance with antifragility buffers ≥30%, unstoppable reserve ≥30%, and
  CI-enforced execution readiness for 4337 account abstraction flows.
- Fully generated UI/artefact suite (Mermaid mindmaps, journey diagrams, dashboards, markdown reports)
  optimised for non-technical owners – a single CLI run rebuilds everything.

Run via:

```bash
python demo/Meta-Agentic-ALPHA-AGI-Jobs-v0/meta_agentic_demo_v7.py
```

All artefacts are emitted to `meta_agentic_alpha_v7/ui` and `meta_agentic_alpha_v7/reports/generated`.
