# Meta-Singularity Overview

Meta-Singularity demonstrates that AGI Jobs v0 (v2) allows a non-technical
owner to spin up a self-governing α-economy in a single run:

- **Identify** anomalies with fused global data streams.
- **Out-learn** the market using open-ended curriculum evolution.
- **Out-think** competitors via a meta-agentic planner with guardian counsel.
- **Out-design** sovereign solutions backed by simulation envelopes.
- **Out-strategise** treasury, governance, and ethics levers simultaneously.
- **Out-execute** across on-chain and off-chain rails with gasless account
  abstraction and CI-confirmed dry runs.

Every control surface is owner-driven: pause/resume scripts, treasury routing,
module upgrades, guardian rotation, antifragility buffers, unstoppable reserves,
and session key management. The console continuously regenerates dashboards,
Mermaid diagrams, and reports with each run.
