  name: "Meta-Agentic α-AGI Jobs Demo"
  narrative: |
    Guided by non-technical owners, the orchestrator composes a full-stack alpha operation that
    senses market anomalies, evolves strategies, designs execution blueprints, coordinates
    capital, and executes under on-chain governance controls without manual coding.
