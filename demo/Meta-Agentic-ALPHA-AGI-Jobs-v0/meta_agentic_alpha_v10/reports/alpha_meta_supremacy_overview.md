# Meta-Agentic α-AGI Jobs Demo V10 — Supremacy Overview

The Supremacy Console empowers a non-technical owner to command an α-AGI grade
wealth engine built on AGI Jobs v0 (v2). Launching `meta_agentic_demo_v10.py`
instantly orchestrates:

- **Identify** — Multi-domain anomaly ingestion across finance, supply chains,
  research, policy, and social signals with antifragility classifiers.
- **Out-Learn** — Open-ended POET curriculum with MuZero-style world models and
  self-improving reward shaping.
- **Out-Think** — Meta-agentic tree search coordinating ≥7 agents through the
  Supremacy Planner lattice.
- **Out-Design** — Creative HyperForge drafting strategies, dashboards, and
  antifragility playbooks with zero manual wiring.
- **Out-Strategise** — Portfolio Navigator balancing unstoppable reserves,
  cross-chain bridges, and guardian quorum priorities.
- **Out-Execute** — ERC-4337 gasless automation with dry-run enforcement,
  unstoppable treasury routes, and guardian override scripts.

Every step honours owner supremacy:

- Instant override switches for treasury, guardians, curriculum, and gasless
  controls.
- Complete visibility into CI V2, antifragility buffers, and guardian quorum in
  real time.
- Reconfigurable parameters, upgrade scripts, and delegation matrix surfaced as
  human-readable controls.

The run emits the Supremacy Masterplan report, dashboard JSON, and scoreboard
snapshots so owners can audit, iterate, and expand without writing code.
