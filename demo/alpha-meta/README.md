# Alpha-Meta Meta-Agentic α-AGI Sovereign Demonstration

The **Alpha-Meta Sovereign Hypergraph** packages the most ambitious AGI Jobs v0 (v2) rehearsal into a single, non-technical friendly showcase. A single launch script deploys the first-class operating system demo, replays the ASI take-off harness with the alpha-meta mission plan, and generates a governance dossier that proves:

- **Meta-agentic orchestration** – an upper-tier agent coordinates deployment, thermodynamics, antifragility, game theory, quantum coherence, and blockchain levers across subordinate AGI swarms.
- **Owner supremacy by design** – every pause switch, thermostat dial, treasury mirror, upgrade queue, and compliance beacon is surfaced through copy-paste commands and audited by the generated owner control matrix.
- **CI parity and auditability** – the run emits CI verification, validation, and owner diagnostic artefacts identical to the mandatory v2 GitHub Actions shield. If any guard drifts, the demo fails loudly.
- **First-class UX** – executive dashboards, HTML dossiers with rendered Mermaid diagrams, and machine-readable JSON enable instant comprehension for non-technical stewards.

## One-command ignition

```bash
# from repository root
demo/alpha-meta/bin/launch.sh
```

The launcher performs:

1. `npm run demo:agi-os:first-class -- --auto-yes` – deploys/contracts, emits the first-class manifest, and refreshes owner wiring.
2. `npm run demo:alpha-meta:full` – computes thermodynamics, equilibria, antifragility curvature, risk residuals, quantum metrics, CI enforcement, and owner automation readiness for the Alpha-Meta mission.
3. `npm run demo:asi-takeoff:local` – replays the ASI take-off harness using `demo/alpha-meta/config/project-plan.alpha-meta.json`, logging multi-agent receipts for nations, wallets, and the owner guild.

All artefacts are collected under `demo/alpha-meta/reports/` with hashes recorded in `alpha-meta-manifest.json`.

## Core outputs

| Artifact | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `alpha-meta-governance-report.md` | Mission narrative explaining thermodynamics, equilibria, risk, antifragility, owner supremacy, and quantum confidence in natural language. |
| `alpha-meta-governance-dashboard.html` | Executive UI with rendered Mermaid diagrams, tables, and call-to-action controls. |
| `alpha-meta-governance-summary.json` | Machine-readable summary for automated monitoring and audits. |
| `alpha-meta-governance-validation.{json,md}` | Deterministic recomputation of every metric with Jarzynski, Hamiltonian, Jacobian, and owner coverage checks. |
| `alpha-meta-ci-verification.json` | CI parity proof showing lint, tests, foundry, coverage, and summary guards enforced on `main`. |
| `alpha-meta-owner-diagnostics.{json,md}` | Results from automated owner command scripts (Hamiltonian audit, reward engine report, upgrade queue status, compliance disclosure). |
| `alpha-meta-owner-matrix.{json,md}` | Authoritative owner control matrix detailing every governance capability, script availability, and verification hook. |
| `alpha-meta-full-run.{json,md}` | Timeline of the full pipeline with Mermaid timeline, metrics, and aggregated health verdict. |
| `alpha-meta-manifest.json` | SHA-256 manifest covering the mission config and every dossier artefact produced by the run. |

## Mission manifest and plan

- `config/mission@alpha-meta.json` – declarative specification containing thermodynamics, Hamiltonian coefficients, equilibrium strategies, antifragility requirements, risk portfolio, owner command catalogue, CI requirements, and quantum thresholds.
- `config/project-plan.alpha-meta.json` – ASI take-off plan enumerating agents, validators, treasury routes, and civilisation-scale jobs for the replay harness.

Modify either file to rehearse new constellations without touching TypeScript.

## Owner empowerment shortcuts

```bash
# Regenerate dossier only
npm run demo:alpha-meta

# Re-run validation/Jarzynski/owner coverage checks
npm run demo:alpha-meta:validate

# Confirm CI branch protection and GitHub workflow parity
npm run demo:alpha-meta:ci

# Execute owner automation suite (Hamiltonian audit, reward report, upgrade status, compliance beacon)
npm run demo:alpha-meta:owner
```

All commands are copy-paste friendly and safe for non-technical stewards. Use `HARDHAT_NETWORK=localhost` (or Sepolia/Mainnet) to target live deployments; every script respects the repository’s environment flags and timelock requirements.

## Dashboards & UX surfaces

After the launcher finishes, reuse existing AGI Jobs dashboards:

- `docker compose up validator-ui enterprise-portal`
- `npm --prefix apps/console run dev`

The generated dashboard HTML references the same contract addresses exported by `deployment-config/oneclick.env`, keeping the console, validator UI, and enterprise portal synchronised with the Alpha-Meta run.

## Evidence for regulators and partners

Every run writes deterministic hashes into the reports manifest. Archive the `demo/alpha-meta/reports/` directory (or upload to IPFS) to provide a verifiable trail covering thermodynamics, owner controls, and CI enforcement. The JSON outputs integrate directly with compliance pipelines or Gnosis Safe automation scripts.

With Alpha-Meta, AGI Jobs v0 (v2) becomes a civilisation-scale control surface that a non-technical owner can command with absolute authority—pause, upgrade, steer thermodynamics, audit quantum coherence, and enforce CI shields—all from a single deterministic workflow.
