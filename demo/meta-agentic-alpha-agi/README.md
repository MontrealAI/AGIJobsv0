# Meta-Agentic α-AGI Platform Demonstration

The **Meta-Agentic α-AGI Platform Demonstration** packages the flagship AGI Jobs v0 (v2) operating system rehearsal, multi-actor ASI take-off simulation, and first-class control surfaces into a single mission for non-technical stewards. It uses **only** the production scripts and dashboards that already ship with this repository—no bespoke contracts or off-repo services are required.

The demonstration emphasises four guarantees:

1. **Meta-agent orchestration** – the first-class demo spawns the protocol, executes the Astral Omnidominion mission, and emits audit-grade dossiers.
2. **Nation + wallet actors** – the `project-plan.meta-alpha.json` plan seeds the ASI take-off harness with sovereign agents and multisig/community wallets.
3. **Owner supremacy** – every pausable module and configurable parameter is surfaced through the Owner Command Centre, CLI scripts, and the control matrix generated by the run.
4. **CI parity** – branch protection checks, coverage thresholds, and deterministic manifests match the enforced v2 CI pipeline.

## Quickstart (one-button launch)

```bash
# from repository root
demo/meta-agentic-alpha-agi/bin/launch.sh
```

The wrapper sets `ASI_TAKEOFF_PLAN_PATH` to the meta-agentic mission plan and executes:

- `npm run demo:agi-os:first-class -- --auto-yes` – deploys/updates the stack, runs the Astral Omnidominion OS demo, emits grand summary + owner control bundle, and verifies manifests.
- `npm run demo:asi-takeoff:local` – replays the deterministic ASI take-off harness with the meta-agentic plan, producing receipts and thermodynamic telemetry for the nation + wallet coalition.

Artefacts land under:

- `reports/agi-os/` – `grand-summary.*`, owner control matrix, Mermaid map, first-class manifest, per-step logs.
- `reports/asi-takeoff/` – dry-run harness output, mission bundle, thermodynamics snapshot referencing the meta-agentic actors.

## UI / UX surfaces

After the launch script completes (or while it runs), start the dashboards that already exist in this repository:

```bash
# Terminal 1 – protocol + dashboards
docker compose up validator-ui enterprise-portal

# Terminal 2 – Owner Console (Vite dev server)
npm --prefix apps/console run dev
```

Open the following in a browser with a wallet (e.g. MetaMask) connected to `http://127.0.0.1:8545` (Anvil default):

| Surface | URL | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Owner Console | http://localhost:5173 | Pause/unpause flows, treasury/stake sliders, ENS sync, parameter updates. |
| Enterprise Portal | http://localhost:3001 | Post new jobs (e.g. additional missions for nations/DAOs) through guided forms. |
| Validator Dashboard | http://localhost:3000 | Commit/reveal validations, dispute monitoring, validator incentives. |

> **Tip:** The Owner Console automatically reads the addresses exported by `deployment-config/oneclick.env`. Use the same browser wallet that deployed the contracts (Hardhat account `0xf39f...` by default) to exercise privileged actions.

## Mission runbook

The runbook in [`RUNBOOK.md`](./RUNBOOK.md) spells out every step for non-technical operators:

1. Environment checks & install instructions.
2. Launch script walkthrough and expected prompts.
3. Owner-controlled pause/unpause drill using `HARDHAT_NETWORK=localhost npm run owner:system-pause -- --action pause` followed by `--action unpause` (or the Owner Console UI toggles).
4. Enterprise Portal job submission on behalf of `aurora.nation.agi.eth` and wallet-governed collectives.
5. Validator dashboard commit/reveal timeline, including raising a sample dispute via CLI (`npm run demo:agi-os:first-class -- --skip-deploy`).
6. Artefact verification and manifest hashing procedure for audit teams.
7. CI verification commands to keep PRs branch-protected.

## Aligning with enforced CI / governance checks

To prove parity with the mandatory CI pipeline (linting, tests, coverage, branch protection), run:

```bash
npm run lint:check
npm test
npm run coverage:check
npm run owner:verify-control
npm run ci:verify-branch-protection
```

These commands match the jobs enforced on PRs. The first-class demo already invokes the Solidity compile/test suite, but running them explicitly before pushing guarantees a fully green status.

## Re-running against other networks

Pass through standard arguments to the launch script—they are forwarded to `demo:agi-os:first-class`:

```bash
# Target Sepolia (requires configured RPC + funded accounts)
HARDHAT_NETWORK=sepolia demo/meta-agentic-alpha-agi/bin/launch.sh --network sepolia --compose
```

`ASI_TAKEOFF_PLAN_PATH` remains bound to the meta-agentic plan, so the ASI take-off receipts will use the same nation/wallet roster even on public testnets or mainnet rehearsals.

## Next steps for operators

- Review `reports/agi-os/grand-summary.html` for the executive-ready dossier.
- Share `reports/asi-takeoff/mission-bundle/` with partners; it includes JSON receipts for each job, thermodynamic telemetry, and manifest hashes.
- Commit the manifest or upload to IPFS for external assurance.
- Iterate on parameters via Owner Console sliders or CLI update scripts (thermostat, stake thresholds, fee burns) using the references printed in the owner control matrix.
