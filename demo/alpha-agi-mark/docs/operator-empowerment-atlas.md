# α-AGI MARK Operator Empowerment Atlas

The atlas distills how AGI Jobs v0 (v2) lets a single non-technical steward conjure, govern, and finalize the α-AGI MARK foresight DEX. Each diagram highlights a distinct perspective of the same orchestration so operators can audit the system visually before ever touching Solidity.

## Non-Technical Operator Journey

    title Alpha Operator Expedition
    section Ignition
      Invoke `npm run demo:alpha-agi-mark`: 5:Operator
      Confirm dry-run / launch intent: 4:Operator
    section Market Resonance
      Watch automated deployments unfurl: 5:Operator
      Observe bonding curve trades + guard rails: 5:Operator
      Witness validator quorum alignment: 4:Operator
    section Sovereign Ascension
      Approve finalization prompt: 5:Operator
      Receive recap dossier + matrix: 5:Operator
      Confidently brief stakeholders using one artifact: 5:Operator
```

## Sovereign Handshake Sequence

    autonumber
    participant O as Operator
    participant AJ as AGI Jobs Orchestrator
    participant NE as NovaSeedNFT
    participant RO as AlphaMarkRiskOracle
    participant EX as AlphaMarkEToken
    participant SV as AlphaSovereignVault
    O->>AJ: Initiate demo command
    AJ->>NE: Deploy & mint Nova-Seed
    AJ->>RO: Install validator council & quorum
    AJ->>EX: Deploy bonding-curve exchange
    AJ->>SV: Deploy vault & designate exchange
    loop Bonding Curve Lifecycle
        AJ->>EX: Simulate investor purchases/sales
        AJ->>RO: Stream validator approvals
        RO-->>AJ: Emit consensus status
    end
    AJ->>EX: Request launch finalization
    EX->>RO: Query validation (or override)
    EX->>SV: Transfer reserve + ignition metadata
    SV-->>EX: Emit acknowledgement event
    AJ-->>O: Deliver recap dossier + owner matrix
```

These visual systems can be printed, embedded in investor decks, or referenced in due diligence reports so the operator can demonstrate total command over α-AGI MARK without touching raw contract code.

## Empowerment Multiplier Glyph

```mermaid
quadrantChart
    title Empowerment signal map
    x-axis Manual Touchpoints --> Automated Execution
    y-axis Low Assurance --> High Assurance
    quadrant-1 Sovereign Autopilot
    quadrant-2 Guided Intelligence
    quadrant-3 Manual Baseline
    quadrant-4 Audit Workbench
    "Manual launch (legacy)" : [0.15, 0.20]
    "AGI Jobs Empowerment Index" : [0.92, 0.94]
    "Validator Telemetry" : [0.70, 0.90]
    "Command Deck Snapshot" : [0.80, 0.85]
```

The empowerment glyph translates the recap’s empowerment stanza into a single chart that any executive can interpret. The
default dry-run places the AGI Jobs empowerment index firmly inside the “Sovereign Autopilot” quadrant, signalling that a
single command delivered dozens of mission actions with board-ready assurance metrics.
