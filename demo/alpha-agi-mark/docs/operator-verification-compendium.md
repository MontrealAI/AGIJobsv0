# Î±-AGI MARK Verification Compendium

*Empowering non-technical operators with a cinematic command of truth, trust, and telemetry.*

## Why this compendium exists

The Î±-AGI MARK demo already automates deployment, governance, and sovereign launch flows. This compendium distills the
triple-verification ecosystem into a playbook a non-technical operator can present to councils, auditors, or investors.
It is intentionally visual, redundant, and rigorous so that every stakeholder can trace how evidence is gathered,
triangulated, and notarised.

## Verification macrocosm

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Operator Assurance))
    Launch Telemetry
      Recap dossier
      Sovereign dashboard
      Integrity timeline
    Mathematical Guarantees
      Bonding curve invariants
      Reserve solvency proofs
      Validator quorum attestations
    Compliance Envelope
      Whitelist matrix
      Owner actuators
      Emergency exit posture
    Independent Triangulation
      Deterministic trade ledger
      First-principles simulator
      On-chain state introspection
```

The orchestrator captures every signal into artefacts that a non-technical user can open in their browser. The
triangulation engine cross-references three independent perspectives so that no single ledger can be tampered with
without detection.

## Operator flow â€“ five minute audit

1. `npm run demo:alpha-agi-mark` â€“ generate the recap dossier and sovereign dashboard.
2. `npm run verify:alpha-agi-mark` â€“ replay the trade ledger and recompute curve maths from first principles.
3. `npm run integrity:alpha-agi-mark` â€“ assemble the confidence dossier ready for board review.
4. `npm run dashboard:alpha-agi-mark` *(optional)* â€“ re-render the cinematic HTML dashboard from any recap snapshot.

These commands all run inside the demo directory and require no Solidity or DevOps knowledge. Every command prints a
confidence index and explains any mismatch, allowing a non-technical operator to intervene rapidly if a discrepancy ever
appears.

## Cross-check choreography

```mermaid

  subgraph A[Primary Orchestrator]
    R{Recap JSON}
    T[Trade Ledger]
    O[Owner Parameter Matrix]
    TL[Timeline]
  end
  subgraph B[Independent Verifier]
    Z[Zod schema guards]
    S[Simulation Engine]
    C[Checksum Auditor]
    P[Phase Coverage Scanner]
  end
  R --> Z
  T --> S
  TL --> P
  O --> P
  Z --> C
  S --> C
  P --> C
  C -->|Confidence Index| D[Integrity Dossier]
  D -->|Confidence â‰¥ 99%?| Verdict{Auto-Signoff}
  Verdict -->|Yes| âœ…[Stakeholder Sign-off]
  Verdict -->|No| ðŸ›‘[Operator Escalates]
```

The new **Phase Coverage Scanner** enforces that the mission timeline spans orchestration through launch and that a
verification milestone is documented. This protects against incomplete operator narratives sneaking through the review
process.

## Presenting to stakeholders

```

The compendium pairs with the existing Operator Command Console and Sovereign Dashboard. Together they let a single
operator hold the attention of a room full of executives and auditors, proving that AGI Jobs v0 (v2) gives them control
over a launch infrastructure that once required an entire engineering organisation.
