# Î±â€‘AGI MARK ðŸ”®ðŸŒŒâœ¨ â€” Foresight DEX & Risk Oracle

The **Î±â€‘AGI MARK** demo showcases how a nonâ€‘technical operator can assemble a
prediction & risk intelligence exchange **purely** with the building blocks that
ship in **AGI Jobs v0 (v2)**. Markets are regular AGI jobs, validators provide
truthful settlement through the onâ€‘chain validation module, and $AGIALPHA
staking guarantees skin in the game for every participant.

The demo lives entirely in `demo/alpha-agi-mark/` and is composed of three
layers:

1. **CLI orchestrator** (`cli/mark.demo.ts`) â€“ spins up a mission run, mints
   funds, posts a foresight market, walks through staking, submissions, and
   validation, and emits reproducible receipts under `reports/<network>/agimark`.
2. **Web3 UI** (`webapp/`) â€“ a Vite + React single page app that lets an
   operator connect a wallet, describe a foresight question, publish it to IPFS,
   and monitor validator resolution in real time. Owner controls (pause,
   thermostat tuning) are surfaced with clear guard rails.
3. **CI** (`.github/workflows/demo-alpha-agi-mark.yml`) â€“ compiles contracts,
   executes the CLI demo on Anvil, builds the web frontâ€‘end, and uploads mission
   receipts to help auditors reâ€‘play the run.

The entire flow uses only the contracts, ABIs, and scripts already bundled with
AGI Jobs v0 (v2). No protocol changes or contract migrations are required.

## Quickstart

> **Prerequisites**: Node 18+, pnpm or npm, and Foundry/Anvil.

```bash
npm ci
npm run demo:agimark:local
```

The script will:

1. boot an Anvil chain;
2. deploy the standard v2 defaults with `scripts/v2/deployDefaults.ts` while
   capturing the address book to
   `reports/localhost/agimark/deploy.json`;
3. mint $AGIALPHA to the demo actors (nation requester, agents, validators);
4. create a foresight market job with IPFS metadata;
5. orchestrate stake deposits, submissions, validator commits/reveals, and
   final settlement;
6. emit `mission.md` plus granular transaction receipts.

Once the CLI mission finishes, start the UI:

```bash
cd demo/alpha-agi-mark/webapp
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Point a browser at http://localhost:5173 and connect a wallet from your Anvil
accounts to publish new markets or participate in validation.
