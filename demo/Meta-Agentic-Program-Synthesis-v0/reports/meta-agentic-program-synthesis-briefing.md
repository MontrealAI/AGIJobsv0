# Owner Briefing – Meta-Agentic Program Synthesis Sovereign Mission

This briefing distills the sovereign mission into an action-ready checklist for platform owners. Every metric originates from triple-verified artefacts generated during the latest run.

## Instant Launch

```bash
./demo/Meta-Agentic-Program-Synthesis-v0/bin/launch.sh
```

Execute the command above to rerun evolutionary synthesis, CI enforcement, and owner diagnostics without manual configuration.

## Mission Snapshot

- **Mission:** Evolutionary Intelligence Forge
- **Owner address:** 0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111
- **Treasury:** 0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222
- **Governance timelock:** 7.00 days
- **Validator council:** sovereign.validator.eth, thermostat.guardian.eth, alpha.operator.eth
- **Sentinel grid:** sentinel.quantum, sentinel.reward-engine, sentinel.timelock, sentinel.contract-size

## System Health

- **Accuracy:** 100.00% | **Novelty:** 77.76% | **Energy envelope:** 73.33
- **Thermodynamic alignment:** 100.00% (Δ̄ 0.00 | Δmax 0.00)
- **Verification consensus:** 1 confirmed • 0 attention • 2 rejected
- **Owner controls readiness:** READY – satisfied: Emergency Pause, Thermostat, Upgrade, Treasury, Compliance
- **Owner scripts:** All declared owner scripts are available and verified.

## Task Highlights

| Task | Mission | Score | Accuracy | Energy | Alignment | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ARC Sentinel Edge Lift | Detect latent pixel edges, amplify discovery, and route high-confidence transformations back into the shared skill graph. | 140.38 | 100.00% | 88.00 | aligned | Deploy via job ARC-SYN-001 |
| Ledger Harmonics Sequencer | Absorb asynchronous cash-flow deltas, stabilise them against the thermodynamic ledger, and emit rebalanced incentive curves for validator coalitions. | 133.04 | 100.00% | 64.00 | aligned | Deploy via job LEDGER-SYN-007 |
| Nova Weave Sequence Optimiser | Elevate alpha sequences into deterministic blueprints that compile into on-chain production payloads with zero manual edits. | 136.05 | 100.00% | 68.00 | aligned | Deploy via job NOVA-SYN-009 |

## Owner Control Panel

| Category | Command | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Emergency Pause | `npm run owner:system-pause -- --action pause` | ✅ |
| Thermostat | `npm run thermostat:update -- --mission demo/Meta-Agentic-Program-Synthesis-v0/config/mission.meta-agentic-program-synthesis.json` | ✅ |
| Upgrade | `npm run owner:upgrade -- --mission demo/Meta-Agentic-Program-Synthesis-v0/config/mission.meta-agentic-program-synthesis.json` | ✅ |
| Treasury | `npm run reward-engine:update -- --mission demo/Meta-Agentic-Program-Synthesis-v0/config/mission.meta-agentic-program-synthesis.json` | ✅ |
| Compliance | `npm run owner:compliance-report` | ✅ |

## Immediate Next Actions

1. Rerun the launch command to regenerate artefacts on the latest network snapshot.
2. Review `meta-agentic-program-synthesis-dashboard.html` for live Mermaid dashboards and verification timelines.
3. Resolve any ❌ owner commands, rerun the launch command, and confirm a ✅ status across controls.
4. Share the manifest and this briefing with governance partners for compliance sign-off.

## Triple-Verification Recap

- **Deterministic replay:** 1 elite pipelines confirmed with zero drift.
- **Baseline dominance:** 100.00% coverage across all mission tasks with evolved pipelines outperforming seeds.
- **Governance sentinels:** 5/5 mandatory owner controls satisfied (pause, thermostat, upgrades, treasury, compliance).

Distribute this briefing freely – it contains reproducible commands and hashed artefacts only, keeping operational keys offline while proving total owner control.
