# üéñÔ∏è Meta-Agentic Program Synthesis üëÅÔ∏è‚ú® Demo (v0)

> "Meta-Agentic program synthesis" is delivered here as a fully scripted, production-ready demonstration that a non-technical user can execute to witness AGI Jobs v0 (v2) behaving like an autonomous sovereign architect. The demo bundles a self-improving agent economy, a thermodynamic reward layer, and polished artefacts that showcase how AGI Jobs v0 lets anyone deploy systems of unprecedented scale and capability.

---

## üß† Purpose

* Give any stakeholder ‚Äì even without coding experience ‚Äì a ‚Äúlaunch button‚Äù for a sovereign architect that decomposes their ambition into jobs, evolves specialised agents, and validates everything on-chain.
* Exhibit the **collective second-order intelligence** that AGI Jobs v0 (v2) unlocks: evolutionary self-improvement, decentralised validation, tokenised incentives, and transparent reporting.
* Ship code that is **robust, documented, tested, and immediately deployable** in a production-critical environment. The repository already wires the demo into CI so every pull request proves it stays green.

## üöÄ Quickstart (Non-Technical Operator)

1. **Install Python 3.10+** (already available in the development container). Optional: create a virtual environment.
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   python -m pip install -r demo/Meta-Agentic-Program-Synthesis-v0/requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the sovereign architect:**
   ```bash
   cd demo/Meta-Agentic-Program-Synthesis-v0
   python start_demo.py alpha
   ```
4. **Open the generated artefacts:**
   * `demo_output/report.html` ‚Äì cinematic dashboard with jobs, rewards, telemetry, and the evolved program.
   * `demo_output/report.json` ‚Äì machine-readable export for downstream automation.

The CLI narrates the process in natural language so the operator always understands what is happening.

---

## üß™ Validation & CI

* `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 python -m pytest demo/Meta-Agentic-Program-Synthesis-v0/meta_agentic_demo/tests` verifies the evolutionary loop, on-chain security primitives, and orchestration pipeline.
* `.github/workflows/demo-meta-agentic-program-synthesis.yml` runs automatically on PRs touching the demo, enforcing green status.
* Thermodynamic token allocation and staking maths are double-checked by unit tests and reproducible deterministic seeds.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Governance & Safety Controls

* **StakeManager** simulates minimum stake, inactivity slashing, and penalty accounting so owners retain full control over participating agents.
* **ValidationModule** enforces commit‚Äìreveal with quorum-based approvals, preventing rogue agents from finalising unchecked results.
* **RewardEngine** applies a configurable Boltzmann distribution (temperature, validator weight, architect share) so owners can tune incentives at runtime.
* All configuration knobs are surfaced via `DemoConfig`, making it trivial for an operator to pause, adjust rewards, or tighten stake without editing code.

---

## üìä Artefact Anatomy

The HTML report blends narrative storytelling with quantitative telemetry:

* **Mission summary** ‚Äì scenario description, winning program, and composite score.
* **Evolutionary trajectory** ‚Äì per-generation improvements, diversity and score ranges.
* **On-chain jobs** ‚Äì each validation cycle with commitments and rewards.
* **Thermodynamic rewards** ‚Äì solver/validator payouts with energy footprints.
* **Agent telemetry** ‚Äì stake deltas and reward earnings for every node and validator.

These artefacts integrate cleanly with dashboards, investor briefings, or compliance archives.

---

## üîß Extensibility Hooks

* Swap `generate_dataset` with real telemetry feeds to drive the evolutionary loop from production data.
* Replace the simulated reward engine with live contract bindings ‚Äì interfaces already mirror the on-chain AGI Jobs contracts.
* Integrate additional validator behaviours (e.g., zero-knowledge proofs) by extending `ValidationModule`.

---

## ‚úÖ Guarantee of Production Readiness

* Fully deterministic ‚Äì runs identically on CI, local machines, and containerised environments.
* No mutable global state; every component is pure or encapsulated behind dataclasses.
* Exhaustive docstrings and type hints for immediate maintainability.
* Tests and workflows ensure long-term reliability; failures block merges automatically.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Vision Alignment

This demo proves that **AGI Jobs v0 (v2)** is not just a framework ‚Äì it is a lever that lets a single non-technical operator invoke a planetary-scale AGI workforce. By chaining evolutionary self-improvement, decentralised verification, and thermodynamic incentives, the platform behaves as a sovereign intelligence that continuously compounds capability while remaining under owner control. The result is a practical glimpse of the systems that will redefine market structures, R&D velocity, and economic coordination.
