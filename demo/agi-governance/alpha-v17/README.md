# 🎖️ Solving α-AGI Governance — α-field v17 Singularity Dominion Command Deck

The **v17 Singularity Dominion mission** is the cinematic proof that AGI Jobs v0 (v2) places a civilisation-scale intelligence lattice entirely under a non-technical owner’s fingertips. Free-energy orchestration, Hamiltonian resource choreography, antifragile incentives, statistical-physics verification, and Ethereum mainnet controls ignite simultaneously, so the owner steers the most capable system on Earth with copy‑paste commands, dashboards, and auditable evidence bundles.

## Why Singularity Dominion is unstoppable

- **Hyperbolic energy leverage.** Dominion binds enthalpy reserves, Landauer compliance, and burn cadence into a real-time Hamiltonian control loop that a non-technical owner can flex from a single script.
- **Physics, game theory, and blockchain fused.** One `npm run` recomputes Gibbs free energy, partition functions, Hamiltonian equilibria, Stackelberg envelopes, antifragility curvature, and pausable selectors with rigorous tolerance checks.
- **Owner-absolute supremacy.** Twelve governance categories (pause, resume, emissions, treasury, sentinel, quantum, upgrade, compliance, resilience, expansion, disclosure, intelligence) map to proven `npm run owner:*` commands. The mission fails if any capability or verification script is missing.
- **Variance-fed antifragility.** Oracle-driven stochastic stress shows σ-driven perturbations increasing welfare and shrinking divergence; quadratic curvature and Monte-Carlo evidence ship in the report.
- **Quantum fidelity instrumentation.** Coherence half-life, Noether charge drift, Fisher information, and thermo↔quantum drift render beside classical thermodynamics so stakeholders watch the lattice stay phase-locked.
- **CI(v2) shield enforced.** The pack refuses to pass unless `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exposes the full green gauntlet (lint, tests, foundry, coverage, summary), concurrency guard, and ≥90% thresholds.
- **Boardroom-ready proof.** Markdown, JSON, and HTML artifacts stream mermaid diagrams, antifragility surfaces, risk matrices, and owner supremacy tables ready for investors, regulators, and treaty partners.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm run demo:agi-governance:alpha-v17
```

Artifacts land in `demo/agi-governance/alpha-v17/reports/`:

- `governance-demo-report-v17.md`
- `governance-demo-summary-v17.json`
- `governance-demo-dashboard-v17.html`

Each run emits a fully narrated dossier covering:

1. Thermodynamic accounting (Gibbs free energy, Landauer compliance, burn cadence, stake Boltzmann envelope).
2. Statistical-physics verification (partition function, entropy, tolerance confirmation, Gibbs delta cross-check).
3. Jarzynski equality reconciliation and Hamiltonian energy ledger.
4. Incentive free-energy flows (mint/burn/slash with Dominion Surge architect share).
5. Five-method equilibrium proof (replicator, RK4, Monte-Carlo, Perron eigenvector, closed form) with method consistency certified inside the Dominion tolerance band.
6. Analytic vs numeric Jacobian comparison with Gershgorin and spectral radius checks.
7. Sigma-driven antifragility curve and welfare gain at σ = 0.28.
8. Quantum lattice diagnostics (coherence decay, Fisher information, Noether charge alignment) with drift alarms.
9. Risk portfolio with coverage weights, residual cross-checks, and board-threshold compliance.
10. Owner supremacy matrix verifying every command + verification script is wired and accessible without coding.
11. Blockchain deployment ledger (DominionGovernor, DominionTreasury, QuantumSentinel, pausable selectors, Safe modules).
12. CI(v2) enforcement summary referencing `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and concurrency guard proofs.

## Deep verification arsenal

| Purpose | Command | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generate Singularity Dominion dossier | `npm run demo:agi-governance:alpha-v17` | `reports/governance-demo-report-v17.md` |
| Independent recomputation of every analytic | `npm run demo:agi-governance:alpha-v17:validate` | `reports/governance-demo-validation-v17.{json,md}` |
| CI(v2) enforcement shield audit | `npm run demo:agi-governance:alpha-v17:ci` | `reports/ci-verification-v17.json` |
| Owner diagnostics bundle (Hamiltonian audit, reward engine, upgrades, compliance) | `npm run demo:agi-governance:alpha-v17:owner-diagnostics` | `reports/owner-diagnostics-v17.{json,md}` |
| Full Singularity Dominion pipeline (generate → validate → CI → owner diagnostics) | `npm run demo:agi-governance:alpha-v17:full` | `reports/governance-demo-full-run-v17.{json,md}` |

Artifacts are deterministic, timestamped, and signed with mission metadata for compliance packets.

## Empowering non-technical operators

- **Copy‑paste omnipotence.** Every owner lever is exported as an `npm run` command. Operators copy, paste, and run—no coding, no env edits.
- **Evidence by default.** Markdown + JSON + HTML outputs ship antifragility curvature, CI shields, quantum confidence, risk residuals, and owner coverage matrices ready for board review.
- **Immersive UI.** `governance-demo-dashboard-v17.html` renders mermaid timelines, antifragility SVGs, quantum lattice cards, and owner command coverage tables in a glassmorphism console.
- **Fail-safe tolerances.** Gibbs free-energy floors, owner coverage ≥ 99.4%, superintelligence index ≥ 0.988, and thermo↔quantum drift ≤ 150,000 kJ are enforced. Deviations raise warnings and fail the run.

## Next steps

1. Run the quickstart command, open `governance-demo-dashboard-v17.html`, and brief stakeholders with the mermaid timelines and antifragility curves.
2. Archive the validation, CI verification, and owner diagnostics artifacts for a provable evidence chain confirming owner control.
3. Follow `RUNBOOK.md` when deploying AGI Jobs v0 (v2) so the Singularity Dominion mission runs on Ethereum mainnet infrastructure with Safe modules, timelocks, and pausable selectors from day zero.

> **Confidence:** α-field v17 Singularity Dominion demonstrates that AGI Jobs v0 (v2) lets a non-technical owner command civilisation-scale intelligence with physics-grade assurance, antifragile reinforcement, and unstoppable blockchain execution.
