# RUNBOOK ‚Äî üéñÔ∏è Solving Œ±-AGI Governance üëÅÔ∏è‚ú® ‚Äî Œ±-field v16 ChronoSovereign

This runbook lets a non-technical owner execute the entire ChronoSovereign mission from a laptop. Every action is copy‚Äëpasteable; no bespoke coding is required. The workflow assumes access to an Ethereum mainnet RPC (or fork) and a hardware wallet, Safe, or custodial signer with owner privileges.

---

## 0. Prerequisites

1. **Clone** the AGI Jobs v0 (v2) repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MontrealAI/AGIJobsv0.git
   cd AGIJobsv0
   npm ci
   ```
2. **Toolchain locks:**
   ```bash
   npm run ci:verify-toolchain
   ```
   Confirms Node 20.18.1, Hardhat, Foundry, and auxiliary utilities match the pinned versions.
3. **Owner signer ready** ‚Äî control the Safe or hardware wallet referenced in [`config/mission@v16.json`](config/mission@v16.json).

## 1. Generate the ChronoSovereign dossier

```bash
npm run demo:agi-governance:alpha-v16
```

Outputs (`demo/agi-governance/alpha-v16/reports/`):

- `governance-demo-report-v16.md`
- `governance-demo-summary-v16.json`
- `governance-demo-dashboard-v16.html`

Review the Markdown dossier. It narrates thermodynamics, statistical physics, incentives, antifragility, risk, quantum alignment, CI enforcement, and owner coverage. Every owner command is written in the report with ready-to-run snippets.

Open the cinematic dashboard to brief stakeholders:

```bash
open demo/agi-governance/alpha-v16/reports/governance-demo-dashboard-v16.html   # macOS
# or
xdg-open demo/agi-governance/alpha-v16/reports/governance-demo-dashboard-v16.html # Linux
```

---

## 2. Recompute the dossier (independent verification)

```bash
npm run demo:agi-governance:alpha-v16:validate
```

Produces `reports/governance-demo-validation-v16.{json,md}` confirming thermodynamics, statistical physics, incentives, equilibria, antifragility curvature, risk residuals, and owner coverage all match the generated summary within tolerance.

---

## 3. Validate CI enforcement (green v2 shield)

```bash
npm run demo:agi-governance:alpha-v16:ci
```

Audits `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and writes `reports/ci-verification-v16.json` showing:

- Jobs `lint`, `tests`, `foundry`, `coverage`, and `summary` exist with the expected display names.
- Push, pull-request, and manual dispatch triggers are enabled.
- Concurrency guard `ci-${workflow}-${ref}` with `cancel-in-progress: true` is present.
- Coverage thresholds ‚â• 90% are enforced both in steps and environment variables.

Attach the JSON artifact to governance evidence packs.

---

## 4. Aggregate owner diagnostics (one-click audit pack)

```bash
npm run demo:agi-governance:alpha-v16:owner-diagnostics
```

Outputs `reports/owner-diagnostics-v16.{json,md}` summarising the results of `owner:audit-hamiltonian`, `reward-engine:report`, `owner:upgrade-status`, and `owner:compliance-report`. The Markdown explains warnings (e.g., placeholder addresses) and highlights any remediation steps.

---

## 5. Run the full ChronoSovereign pipeline (optional)

```bash
npm run demo:agi-governance:alpha-v16:full
```

Produces `reports/governance-demo-full-run-v16.{json,md}` capturing step durations, antifragility curvature, CI shield verdicts, and owner readiness so a board can review the entire drill from a single artifact.

---

## 6. Execute on-chain owner controls (optional live drill)

Each command can be run via the CLI, Safe transaction builder, or Etherscan write interface. Replace placeholder addresses with deployment addresses.

1. **Pause the platform instantly (emergency brake):**
   ```bash
   npm run owner:system-pause -- --network mainnet --pause true
   ```
   Validate pause state using `npm run owner:verify-control`.

2. **Tune Hamiltonian parameters:**
   ```bash
   npm run owner:command-center -- --network mainnet --set-lambda 1.012 --set-inertia 1.22
   ```

3. **Adjust reward engine (Gibbs alignment):**
   ```bash
   npm run reward-engine:update -- --network mainnet --burn-bps 680 --treasury-bps 220
   ```

4. **Update disclosure policy:**
   ```bash
   npm run owner:update-all -- --network mainnet --module GlobalDisclosure --acknowledgement "ChronoSovereign protocol live."
   ```

5. **Queue the Chrono upgrade bundle:**
   ```bash
   npm run owner:upgrade -- --network mainnet --proposal governance_bundle_v16.json
   npm run owner:upgrade-status -- --network mainnet
   ```

6. **Rotate sentinel guardians:**
   ```bash
   npm run owner:rotate -- --network mainnet --role Sentinel --count 9
   npm run monitoring:sentinels
   ```

7. **Trigger resilience drill and resume:**
   ```bash
   npm run owner:emergency -- --network mainnet --scenario antifragile-drill
   npm run owner:surface -- --network mainnet --resume
   npm run owner:verify-control
   ```

Document transaction hashes in the dossier under the ‚ÄúOwner Execution Log‚Äù.

**Tip:** If any command shows ‚ö†Ô∏è in the owner matrix, run `npm run owner:surface` to regenerate automation metadata before redeploying.

The ChronoSovereign mission proves that AGI Jobs v0 (v2) is the civilisation-scale intelligence engine that a non-technical owner can command with physics-grade assurance and unstoppable blockchain execution.
