# 🎖️ Solving α-AGI Governance — α-field v16 ChronoSovereign Mission Pack

The **v16 ChronoSovereign mission** is the definitive proof that AGI Jobs v0 (v2) lets a non-technical owner pilot a civilisation-scale superintelligence without writing a single line of code. Thermodynamic clocks, antifragile incentives, Hamiltonian control, and Ethereum-grade governance fuse into a cinematic drill that renders every decision as copy‑paste commands, dashboards, and evidence bundles.

## Why ChronoSovereign is different

- **Time-domain supremacy.** ChronoSovereign models the α-field as a Hamiltonian clock. Free-energy margins, Landauer burns, and Stackelberg advantages are time-synchronised and locked under the owner’s keys.
- **Physics, game theory, and blockchain in one click.** A single `npm run` command recomputes Gibbs free energy, statistical-physics partitions, replicator equilibria, antifragility curvature, and contract pausable selectors.
- **Owner-dominant control surface.** Ten governance categories (pause, resume, parameter, treasury, sentinel, upgrade, compliance, quantum, expansion, resilience) are verified against real `npm run owner:*` commands so the owner can update any subsystem instantly.
- **Temporal antifragility.** Sigma-driven Monte-Carlo sweeps prove that adversarial variance *increases* welfare and tightens divergence, with quadratic curvature certified above the Chrono minimum.
- **Quantum alignment instrumentation.** Noether charge drift, coherence decay, Fisher information, and thermal envelopes are rendered side-by-side. Thresholds enforce quantum confidence ≥ 0.986 and thermodynamic ↔ quantum drift ≤ 180,000 kJ.
- **CI(v2) enforcement built in.** The mission will not sign off unless `.github/workflows/ci.yml` still exposes the full green path (lint, tests, foundry, coverage, summary), concurrency guards, and coverage thresholds.
- **Evidence for the boardroom.** Every script emits Markdown, JSON, and HTML artifacts with mermaid diagrams, antifragility plots, risk matrices, and owner supremacy tables ready for regulators, investors, and strategic partners.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm run demo:agi-governance:alpha-v16
```

Artifacts live in `demo/agi-governance/alpha-v16/reports/`:

- `governance-demo-report-v16.md`
- `governance-demo-summary-v16.json`
- `governance-demo-dashboard-v16.html`

Each run generates a fully narrated dossier with:

1. Thermodynamic accounting (Gibbs free energy, Landauer compliance, burn cadence).
2. Statistical-physics verification (partition function, entropy, tolerance confirmation).
3. Jarzynski equality reconciliation.
4. Incentive free-energy ledger (mint/burn/slash with Chrono Strategist share).
5. Five-method equilibrium proof (replicator, RK4, Monte-Carlo, Perron eigenvector, closed form).
6. Analytic vs numeric Jacobian comparison with Gershgorin & spectral radius checks.
7. Temporal antifragility curve and welfare gain at σ = 1.2.
8. Quantum lattice diagnostics with coherence decay, Fisher information, and Noether charge.
9. Risk portfolio with coverage weights and residual cross-checks.
10. Owner supremacy matrix verifying every command + verification script is wired and present.
11. Blockchain deployment ledger (ChronoGovernor, ChronoTreasury, QuantumSentinel, pausable selectors, Safe modules).
12. CI(v2) enforcement summary referencing `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Deep verification arsenal

| Purpose | Command | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generate ChronoSovereign dossier | `npm run demo:agi-governance:alpha-v16` | `reports/governance-demo-report-v16.md` |
| Independent recomputation of every analytic | `npm run demo:agi-governance:alpha-v16:validate` | `reports/governance-demo-validation-v16.{json,md}` |
| CI(v2) enforcement shield audit | `npm run demo:agi-governance:alpha-v16:ci` | `reports/ci-verification-v16.json` |
| Owner diagnostics bundle (Hamiltonian audit, reward engine, upgrades, compliance) | `npm run demo:agi-governance:alpha-v16:owner-diagnostics` | `reports/owner-diagnostics-v16.{json,md}` |
| Full ChronoSovereign pipeline (generate → validate → CI → owner diagnostics) | `npm run demo:agi-governance:alpha-v16:full` | `reports/governance-demo-full-run-v16.{json,md}` |

All artifacts are deterministic, timestamped, and ready for compliance or investor packets.

## Empowering non-technical operators

- **Copy-paste omnipotence.** Every owner lever is exposed as an `npm run` command with arguments prefilled. Operators copy and execute without editing code.
- **Evidence on rails.** Markdown + JSON outputs include antifragility curvature, CI shields, quantum confidence, risk residuals, and owner coverage matrices ready for archival.
- **Cinematic UI.** `governance-demo-dashboard-v16.html` renders mermaid timelines, antifragility SVGs, quantum lattice cards, and command coverage tables inside a glassmorphism console.
- **Fail-safe tolerances.** Gibbs free-energy floors, owner coverage ≥ 99%, superintelligence index ≥ 0.985, and quantum confidence ≥ 0.986 are enforced. Deviations trigger warnings and fail the run.

## Next steps

1. Run the quickstart command, open `governance-demo-dashboard-v16.html`, and walk stakeholders through the mermaid timelines and antifragility curves.
2. Archive the validation, CI verification, and owner diagnostics artifacts for a complete evidence chain proving unstoppable owner control.
3. Follow `RUNBOOK.md` when deploying AGI Jobs v0 (v2) so the ChronoSovereign mission runs on Ethereum mainnet with Safe modules, timelocks, and pausable selectors from the outset.

> **Confidence:** α-field v16 ChronoSovereign demonstrates that AGI Jobs v0 (v2) is the civilisation-scale intelligence engine a non-technical owner can command with physics-grade assurance, antifragile reinforcement, and unstoppable blockchain execution.
