# Solving α‑AGI Governance Demonstration

This runbook assembles a fully owner-governed governance rehearsal for AGI Jobs v0 (v2) using only
components that already ship in this repository.  It intentionally stays within the
**existing production toolchain** so that the flow can be replayed against a fork, a public testnet, or
Ethereum mainnet with no code changes.

The demonstration mirrors the "Solving α‑AGI Governance" storyline: multiple nation-scale actors table
sovereign policy proposals, wallet-controlled validators arbitrate those proposals through the
commit–reveal pipeline, and the contract owner steers every dial (pausing, quorum thresholds, stake
levels) in real time.  No Solidity changes are required; everything rides on the audited v2 protocol.

> ✅ _Target audience_: non-technical owners and policy staff who only have access to a browser wallet and
> the standard AGI Jobs owner scripts.

## 1. Prepare the workspace

1. Install dependencies once: `npm install`.
2. Ensure the canonical AGIALPHA token address is funded on the target network.  For local Hardhat
   rehearsals, the standard deploy scripts inject the mock bytecode automatically.
3. Export the deployment configuration you wish to reuse.  For example, to regenerate the secure
   defaults bundle: `npm run deploy:checklist -- --network hardhat`.

All subsequent steps use the contract addresses recorded by the existing deployment automation in
`deployment-config/generated/` or `deployment-config/latest-deployment.<network>.json`.

## 2. Launch the owner command surface

Run the curated owner quickstart to populate every adjustable governance control in one shot:

```bash
npx ts-node --compiler-options '{"module":"commonjs"}' scripts/v2/ownerControlQuickstart.ts \
  --network hardhat \
  --config deployment-config/mainnet.json
```

This produces:

* an **Owner Dashboard** (Markdown + JSON) enumerating the current parameters across JobRegistry,
  StakeManager, ValidationModule, IdentityRegistry, FeePool, and TaxPolicy;
* a **Mission Bundle** with transaction payloads for pausing/unpausing, quorum adjustments, validator
  staking thresholds, dispute fees, and reward/penalty routing; and
* a ready-to-sign change ticket for governance archives.

Non-technical operators only need to copy/paste the generated JSON into their preferred multisig or
safe; every call uses existing ABI definitions.

## 3. Spin up the civic UI

1. `cd apps/onebox`
2. Create a `.env.local` with your orchestrator endpoint (or leave it empty to operate in offline
   receipt mode):
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ONEBOX_ORCHESTRATOR_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ONEBOX_ORCHESTRATOR_TOKEN=demo
   ```
3. Start the interface: `npm run dev`.
4. Connect any browser wallet.  The default chat now advertises the "Solving α‑AGI Governance" flow and
   walks the operator through proposal intake, validator commit, reveal, and finalization, using only
   the v2 protocol endpoints.

The Onebox UI already exposes run receipts, transaction hashes, and autogenerated plan summaries, so no
additional React work is necessary—this runbook simply configures the default prompts around the new
scenario.

## 4. Simulate nation-scale proposals

Use the existing `test/v2` helpers to fast-forward a multi-actor scenario on a fork or Hardhat:

```bash
npx hardhat test --no-compile test/v2/governanceReward.integration.test.js \
  --grep "global governance council"
```

That test deploys the production contracts, onboards multiple employers (nations), and exercises the
commit–reveal validation cycle that adjudicates policy proposals.  Rerunning it against a forked mainnet
state proves the flow stays green under live conditions.

## 5. Showcase wallet-controlled validators

Leverage the shipped validator CLI to perform commits and reveals from plain wallets:

```bash
npm run agent:validator -- \
  --job 1 \
  --subdomain validator.demo.agi.eth \
  --commit \
  --network hardhat
```

The same CLI supports the reveal stage by swapping `--commit` for `--reveal --verdict approve`.  These
commands are fully scriptable, letting you pre-record validator participation for demonstrations.

## 6. Keep owner control front and centre

* Pause or resume the entire marketplace via `npm run owner:system-pause -- --pause true`.
* Re-issue protocol parameters at any time using the generated mission bundle from step 2.
* Verify that ownership has not drifted by running `npm run owner:verify-control`.

Every owner command is read-only until the operator intentionally signs the transaction; this preserves
clear separation between rehearsals and production execution.

## 7. Export artefacts for stakeholders

* `reports/owner/` — automatically updated dashboards and change tickets.
* `apps/onebox/.next/cache/` — contains the chat transcript, validation receipts, and execution logs
  that can be shared with policy teams.
* `reports/test-results/` — populated when CI (see below) runs the governance integration suite.

These assets illustrate how AGI Jobs v0 (v2) empowers entire administrations without demanding any new
code deployments.

## 8. CI: keep the pipeline green

The standard `ci.yml` workflow already executes linting, type-checking, contract unit tests, and the
critical integration suites (including the governance pathways above).  Ensure branch protection
requires that workflow to pass before merges—no extra YAML is needed.

---

By chaining together the existing deployment automation, owner tooling, validator CLI, and Onebox
interface, this demonstration delivers a nation-scale, owner-controlled governance experience today.
No new smart contracts, no bespoke APIs—just disciplined orchestration of the platform that already
ships in this repository.
