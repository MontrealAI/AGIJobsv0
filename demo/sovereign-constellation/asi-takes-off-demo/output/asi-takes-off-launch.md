# ASI Takes Off — Sovereign Constellation Launch Manifest
Precision meets destiny as Sovereign Constellation deploys a civilization-scale workforce for a single director.

Mission control promise: Launch a planetary AGI workforce without writing code; every signature and override lives in your wallet.
Constellation scope: Three autonomous AGI hubs span research, industrial execution, and civic governance while staying under the owner's wallet control.

## Launch sequence for non-technical directors
- Spin up the full constellation: npm run demo:sovereign-constellation
- Brief the owner command center: npm run demo:sovereign-constellation:owner
- Compute owner atlas and thermostat plan: npm run demo:sovereign-constellation:plan
- Execute CI-quality smoke: npm run demo:sovereign-constellation:ci
- CI Guardrail: Root CI enforces tests, builds, and autotune computation on every commit via demo:sovereign-constellation:ci.
  Owner visibility: Branch protections require all constellation checks green before merge.

## Pillars of deployment
### Meta-Agentic α-AGI Orchestration
Spin up the Sovereign Constellation mission where Helios, Triton, and Athena act as one self-directing swarm.

Key highlights:
- One intent explodes into sequenced jobs across three networks without the operator touching RPC plumbing.
- Cross-network payloads are pre-signed so the wallet simply routes them to mainnet, Arbitrum, or Optimism as required.
- Mission telemetry is streamed back into the console so the director can monitor AGI taskflow state in real time.

### α-AGI Governance & Absolute Owner Control
Surface every governance lever in one atlas and exercise safe-pause, retuning, and authority rotation instantly.

Key highlights:
- Owner console links land directly on explorer write panels for JobRegistry, ValidationModule, StakeManager, and SystemPause.
- Thermostat recommendations auto-fill commit/reveal windows, stake floors, and dispute modules for one-click application.
- Gnosis Safe or EOA owners can reassign governance at any moment with pre-encoded transactions from the console.

### Making the Chain Disappear
A non-technical operator signs missions like email – the constellation handles chain IDs, proofs, and settlements.

Key highlights:
- Wallet prompts arrive in correct order per hub; no manual network switching or ABI handling is required.
- All sensitive keys stay in the wallet – the orchestrator only prepares payloads and never touches custody.
- Mission plans preview exact rewards, URIs, and chains before the first signature so nothing is opaque.

### Recursive Self-Improvement
Close the feedback loop: telemetry, autotune, and owner directives iterate the system to higher resilience automatically.

Key highlights:
- Thermostat analytics adjust validator economics whenever entropy or participation drifts.
- Mission data can spawn follow-up jobs immediately so learnings re-enter the labour market without human glue.
- Owners can chain autotune actions directly from the UI, applying them to any hub in seconds.

### Winning the AI Race
Demonstrate the superintelligent economic engine: orchestrate planetary labour faster than any competitor could react.

Key highlights:
- Global scale in one command – research, fabrication, and governance surge together under a single wallet.
- Stake-backed validation plus dispute escalation ensure uncompromising trust while scaling to civilization workloads.
- Owners retain a universal kill-switch and upgrade path so strategic supremacy never sacrifices control.

## Systems matrix — Sovereign Constellation
### Meta-Agentic α-AGI Orchestration
The Constellation Orchestrator decomposes a single intent into coordinated research, industrial, and governance jobs across Helios, Triton, and Athena.
Operator workflow:
- Select the Flagship Mission: ASI Takes Off in the console mission selector to autoload the cross-hub plan.
- Use the mission preview to inspect every unsigned transaction, then sign each prompt from the wallet to dispatch jobs to their target networks.
- Monitor the jobs table; each hub streams confirmations once the orchestrator finalizes createJob calls.
Owner supremacy:
- SystemPause :: pause() / unpause() — Freeze or resume every orchestrated hub at once using the shared SystemPause helper wired in deployConstellation.ts.
- JobRegistry :: setDisputeModule(address) — Swap dispute logic for any hub to escalate arbitration when orchestrated missions surface anomalies.
Automation spine:
- Bootstrap orchestrator and console: npm run demo:sovereign-constellation
  Spawns the orchestrator server, wallet-first console, and local RPC so a non-technical operator can coordinate hubs in minutes.
- Seed cross-network jobs: npm run demo:sovereign-constellation:seed
  Primes each hub with sample telemetry so the orchestrator showcases deterministic cross-chain job finalisation.
Verification artefacts:
- config/playbooks.json#asi-takes-off — Defines the exact createJob payloads for all hubs proving orchestration is scripted rather than aspirational.
- test/SovereignConstellation.t.ts — Integration test executes the flagship playbook end-to-end to guarantee orchestration never regresses.
Assurance: A single wallet operator can span networks with one plan while the owner retains a global kill-switch.

### α-AGI Governance
Every module across the constellation is owner-configurable, surfacing direct writeContract links and Safe payloads so governance never leaves human control.
Operator workflow:
- Open the Owner Governance Atlas from the console to inspect each module's actionable controls.
- Use the "Apply thermostat plan" button after reviewing recommendations to push validated parameter updates.
- If escalation is needed, trigger the SystemPause card and resume once validators complete dispute review.
Owner supremacy:
- ValidationModule :: setCommitRevealWindows(uint256,uint256) — Rebalance cadence instantly whenever validator participation drifts.
- StakeManager :: setMinStake(uint256) — Adjust risk exposure and validator skin-in-the-game without redeploying contracts.
- IdentityRegistry :: addAdditionalValidator(address) — Onboard or rotate trusted validators as the mission footprint expands.
Automation spine:
- Generate owner atlas: npm run demo:sovereign-constellation:atlas
  Outputs a JSON control matrix enumerating every owner-only method so governance coverage is auditable.
- Rotate governance: npm run demo:sovereign-constellation:ci
  Runs the complete CI, builds app/server artefacts, and ensures governance rotation scripts remain functional.
Verification artefacts:
- scripts/rotateConstellationGovernance.ts — Transfers ownership to a Safe and validates that only the owner address can mutate configuration.
- config/asiTakesOffMatrix.json — Documents pausing, upgrades, and emergency levers guaranteeing ownership assurances remain explicit.
Assurance: Owner-first controls are provably wired across every hub, letting leadership pause, upgrade, or expand participation on demand.

### Making the Chain Disappear
Wallet-first UX abstracts all RPC plumbing so directors simply sign prompts while the orchestrator tags chain metadata automatically.
Operator workflow:
- Launch the console and connect a wallet; the interface auto-detects hubs and networks from constellation.hubs.json.
- Preview the flagship playbook to review chain IDs and required signatures with human-readable annotations.
- Approve the orchestrator-prepared transactions in sequence; MetaMask routes each signature to the correct network.
Owner supremacy:
- Console :: orchestratorBase override — Operators can point the UI at staging or production orchestrators without touching code, guaranteeing safe rollouts.
- Orchestrator :: POST /constellation/:hub/tx/* — Endpoints emit unsigned payloads so the owner never delegates key custody to infrastructure.
Automation spine:
- Console build: npm run demo:sovereign-constellation:app:build
  Produces a static production bundle for immediate hosting with prewired API targets.
- Server build: npm run demo:sovereign-constellation:server:build
  Generates the orchestrator server artefact exposing the wallet-first API catalogue.
Verification artefacts:
- cypress/e2e/sovereign-constellation.cy.ts — UI smoke test asserts that non-technical flows render the launch sequence and control deck without manual setup.
- server/index.ts — Express routes serialize transactions with chainId and rpcUrl fields proving the wallet can route prompts automatically.
Assurance: All blockchain interaction remains invisible to the operator—security and simplicity move in lockstep.

### Recursive Self-Improvement
Telemetry-driven thermostat logic continuously recommends staking, cadence, and pausing adjustments so the constellation self-optimises under owner supervision.
Operator workflow:
- Run npm run demo:sovereign-constellation:plan to compute recommendations from autotune.telemetry.json.
- Review suggested actions inside the console, then dispatch supported updates directly from the owner control panel.
- Re-run the plan after missions settle to confirm entropy and participation have rebounded.
Owner supremacy:
- Autotune :: computeAutotunePlan(telemetry) — Shared library cross-checks mission telemetry and surfaces actions in both CLI and API surfaces.
- StakeManager :: setMinStake(uint256) — Owner applies thermostat recommendations to harden validator incentives immediately.
Automation spine:
- Thermostat planning: npm run demo:sovereign-constellation:plan
  Deterministically recomputes the self-improvement plan and stores receipts under reports/ for auditability.
- Server plan endpoint: GET /constellation/thermostat/plan
  Exposes the same plan to the UI ensuring humans and agents share one feedback loop.
Verification artefacts:
- shared/autotune.mjs — Implements PID-inspired tuning logic used by both CLI scripts and server routes.
- test/AutotunePlan.t.ts — Hardhat test asserts thermostat recommendations are stable across releases.
Assurance: Feedback loops remain explainable—owners choose when to apply them, yet the system keeps learning.

### Winning the AI Race
Sovereign Constellation composes audited AGI Jobs v2 modules, deterministic CI, and wallet-first UX so a single organisation wields civilisation-scale leverage immediately.
Operator workflow:
- Execute the ASI launch sequence from the console to deploy hubs, preview missions, and apply owner assurances end-to-end.
- Keep the CI workflow demo-asi-takeoff.yml green to guarantee every push retains production readiness.
- Broadcast the CLI briefing (npm run demo:sovereign-constellation:asi-takes-off) to align stakeholders on the operating doctrine.
Owner supremacy:
- CI :: demo-asi-takeoff.yml — Workflow enforces full-stack validation so ownership can demand evidence that the superintelligent platform remains trustworthy.
- Deploy scripts :: deployConstellation.ts — Mainnet-ready script deploys hubs, wires pause circuits, and hands control to the owner-defined Safe.
Automation spine:
- Full CI: npm run demo:sovereign-constellation:ci
  Runs contract tests, server/app builds, and thermostat planning so releases stay production-ready.
- ASI Take-Off workflow: .github/workflows/demo-asi-takeoff.yml
  Public GitHub check publishes artefacts proving the demo passed across deterministic and local environments.
Verification artefacts:
- .github/workflows/demo-asi-takeoff.yml — Workflow log shows both deterministic kit and local launch succeed before merges.
- reports/asi-takeoff — Receipts archived on each run capture job IDs, telemetry, and governance state for executive review.
Assurance: Production-critical checks stay enforced on PRs and main, proving AGI Jobs v0 (v2) is the decisive advantage.

## Victory assurance plan
Hardens the Sovereign Constellation launch so a single operator can command audited hubs, enforce owner supremacy, and validate telemetry without writing code.

Objectives:
- Ignite the Meta-Agentic Mission: Helios, Triton, and Athena accept the asi-takes-off playbook transactions and emit JobCreated events per hub. (verify via Run npm run demo:sovereign-constellation to launch the orchestrator console and sign each prepared transaction.).
- Assert Owner Governance: Owner atlas exports list SystemPause, ValidationModule, StakeManager, and JobRegistry controls for every hub under the operator's wallet. (verify via Execute npm run demo:sovereign-constellation:atlas and inspect reports/sovereign-constellation/owner-atlas.json.).
- Seal Telemetry Feedback: Thermostat autotune plan recommends commit/reveal, stake, and dispute parameters that reflect latest telemetry inputs. (verify via Run npm run demo:sovereign-constellation:plan and confirm console output lists recommended parameters.).

Owner control drills:
- SystemPause :: pause — run curl -XPOST localhost:8090/constellation/helios/tx/pause -d '{"action":"pause"}' and confirm Explorer shows JobRegistry pause transaction signed by owner; CLI prints "Helios paused" message..
- ValidationModule :: setCommitRevealWindows — run curl -XPOST localhost:8090/constellation/triton/tx/validation/commit-window -d '{"commitWindowSeconds":3600,"revealWindowSeconds":1800}' and confirm Hardhat console or Etherscan events show ValidationWindowUpdated with requested values..
- StakeManager :: setMinStake — run curl -XPOST localhost:8090/constellation/athena/tx/stake/min -d '{"minStakeWei":"2000000000000000000"}' and confirm Autotune plan summary reflects the new minimum stake after execution..

CI guardrails:
- Demo CI: npm run demo:sovereign-constellation:ci — Runs contract tests, server schema validation, React build, and thermostat planning on every branch.
- Owner Parameter Matrix: npm run owner:parameters — Confirms every adjustable parameter remains mapped to owner-only functions before promotion.
- Branch Protection: npm run ci:verify-branch-protection — Verifies GitHub branch rules enforce constellation CI and owner governance checks.

Telemetry metrics:
- averageParticipation target >= 0.80 (source autotune.telemetry.json › summary.averageParticipation; verify npm run demo:sovereign-constellation:plan outputs participation percentage.).
- commitWindowSeconds target adaptive (source autotune.telemetry.json › summary.commitWindowSeconds; verify Server GET /constellation/thermostat/plan returns recommended window.).
- minStakeWei target >= 1 ether (source autotune.telemetry.json › summary.minStakeWei; verify Autotune CLI displays Ether formatted minimum stake.).

Assurance pillars:
- unstoppable: Victory plan keeps the constellation ready to relaunch instantly even after pauses by documenting restart scripts and telemetry baselines.
- ownerSovereignty: Every control step emphasises owner signatures; no automation holds private keys or bypasses wallet consent.
- readiness: CI gates and telemetry metrics provide objective readiness checks prior to mission escalation.

## Owner assurances
- pausing: SystemPause addresses broadcast owner-triggered halts to every hub simultaneously.
- upgrades: Each module exposes transferOwnership and upgrade hooks guarded by owner-only modifiers.
- emergencyResponse: Owner atlas callouts reference the exact explorer URLs for critical overrides.

## Next actions
1. Open the Sovereign Constellation console (`npm run demo:sovereign-constellation`).
2. Follow the launch sequence above; every wallet prompt arrives pre-tagged with its target network.
3. Apply thermostat recommendations via the owner console and confirm telemetry metrics.
4. Execute owner control drills and CI guardrails to prove readiness.
5. Archive this manifest with mission artefacts to document the launch.

• Victory plan emphasises unstoppable readiness and owner sovereignty.
