# üéñÔ∏è REDENOMINATION üëÅÔ∏è‚ú® Demo

Welcome to the sovereign-grade redenomination showcase for **AGI Jobs v0 (v2)**. This directory packages an end-to-end,
non-technical mission that demonstrates how a single command invokes the platform‚Äôs governed autonomy, verifiable compute,
and institutional observability. It is designed to convince even the most risk-averse stakeholder that AGI Jobs v0 (v2) is the
superintelligent control room for global-scale labor markets.

New in this iteration:

- **Multilingual mission control** ‚Äì all storyboard copy is available in English and French, with instant toggles so
  executive teams across jurisdictions can run the drill together.
- **Interactive phase navigator** ‚Äì the primary storyboard now ships with an adaptive phase selector that lets a
  non-technical sponsor rehearse each lifecycle checkpoint step-by-step.
- **Artefact integrity verification** ‚Äì scenario validation now inspects translation catalogues and UI anchors to
  guarantee nothing drifts out of sync before the automation scripts are executed.
- **Console mission control** ‚Äì a guided CLI (`npm run demo:redenomination:mission-control`) lets non-technical leaders
  explore governance levers, audit invariants, and export-ready Mermaid diagrams interactively.
- **Scenario-driven orchestration graph** ‚Äì the Mermaid topology now lives inside `scenario.json`, powering the web
  storyboard, CLI, and printable runbooks from a single source of truth.

---

## Why this demo matters

- **Governance-first** ‚Äì every privileged action routes through the multi-signature timelock and the moderator council can
  pause or arbitrate at any time.
- **Provable execution** ‚Äì agents sign and hash every deliverable, validators run commit‚Äìreveal voting, and certificate NFTs
  enshrine results on-chain.
- **Institutional telemetry** ‚Äì audit events, Prometheus metrics, and Grafana dashboards ensure regulators and executives share
a live ground truth.
- **One-click empowerment** ‚Äì run a single npm script and receive a narrated simulation plus UI assets that explain each
  subsystem without requiring developer knowledge.

## Quickstart

1. Install dependencies and compile the protocol (optional but recommended for first-time setup).

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run compile
   ```

2. Prove the artefacts are production-grade:

   ```bash
   npm run demo:redenomination:verify
   ```

   The verifier inspects `scenario.json`, validates referenced documentation paths, cross-checks automation commands against
   `package.json`, and confirms the storyboard ships with a Mermaid orchestration graph and exportable control-room dataset. If
   anything drifts, the script fails fast with explicit remediation guidance.

3. Launch the **REDENOMINATION** mission transcript:

   ```bash
   npm run demo:redenomination
   ```

   This command prints the governed scenario using `scenario.json`, highlighting actors, phases, operational guardrails, and
   follow-up automation hooks that a non-technical operator can trigger verbatim.

4. Launch the **Owner Command Console** to review live guardrails and emergency levers:

   ```bash
   npm run demo:redenomination:owner-console
   ```

   This guided CLI inspects the redenominated stake and job registry parameters, surfaces governance automation commands, and
   rehearses emergency pause and moderation playbooks so the owner can exercise absolute control.

5. Open the interactive **Mission Control** console:

   ```bash
   npm run demo:redenomination:mission-control
   ```

   Navigate the governed lifecycle, governance surfaces, verification invariants, and the shared Mermaid graph from a
   conversational prompt designed for decision makers.

6. Run the **Guardian emergency drill** to rehearse pause, parameter, and dispute authority:

   ```bash
   npm run demo:redenomination:guardian-drill
   ```

   The drill validates core staking/timelock invariants and presents interactive or non-interactive playbooks for
   moderators, governance signers, and platform owners.

7. Open the immersive UI storyboard in any browser:

   ```bash
   npx serve demo/REDENOMINATION
   ```

   The `index.html` page auto-loads the shared scenario, renders the mermaid architecture graph, and provides a responsive
   timeline, guardrails view, and a one-command runbook. No bundlers or build steps required.

## Scenario anatomy

| Component        | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scenario.json`  | Canonical description of actors, lifecycle phases, operational metrics, and authoritative runbook references. |
| `scripts/`       | Automation entry points. `verify-scenario.mjs` hardens artefacts, while `run-demo.mjs` streams a narrated transcript mirroring the real deployment plan.  |
| `index.html`     | All-in-one web storyboard with mermaid diagrams, responsive cards, and actionable CTAs for stakeholders.      |

The JSON file is intentionally minimal so that governance can amend parameters (stake requirements, committee size, audit
rate) without modifying scripts.

## Extend the mission

- **Regenerate confidence:** run `npm run demo:redenomination:verify` after editing the scenario or UI assets to reconfirm every
  reference remains production-safe.
- **Connect to live infrastructure:** export `NETWORK=sepolia` and supply deployed contract addresses through `deployment-config/`
  before invoking the normal deployment scripts.
- **Update policy controls:** run `npm run owner:command-center` to propose allow/deny list changes in the Policy Registry.
- **Trigger safety drills:** execute `npm run owner:system-pause` followed by `npm run owner:command-center` to walk through the
  full emergency-stop playbook.
- **Instrument monitoring:** run `npm run monitoring:validate` to ensure Prometheus + Grafana dashboards are healthy before
  switching to mainnet scale.

---

## Non-technical operator checklist

1. **Deploy stack** ‚Äì `npm run deploy:oneclick:auto` (accept defaults or point to mainnet addresses).
2. **Transfer control** ‚Äì approve the generated governance proposal to move ownership to the timelock multi-sig.
3. **Onboard identities** ‚Äì `npm run identity:register` to bind ENS subdomains to agent and validator nodes.
4. **Set guardrails** ‚Äì `npm run owner:parameters` to review and update stake thresholds, policy categories, and slashing
   rules.
5. **Simulate governance** ‚Äì `npm run demo:redenomination:mission-control` to rehearse the live operational sequence before
   scheduling mainnet actions.
6. **Launch job** ‚Äì follow the chat-style UI prompts to post the redenomination job and watch validator commits stream in.
7. **Review telemetry** ‚Äì open the Grafana dashboards defined in `monitoring/dashboards/` to monitor throughput, validator
   participation, and anomaly alerts in real time.

## Verifiability & compliance hooks

- **Audit trail:** every transaction emits audit events consumed by the subgraph and surfaced through the `observability:smoke`
  script.
- **Security posture:** see `SECURITY.md` plus the bug bounty program to invite third-party testing.
- **Formal assurances:** run `npm run echidna` and `npm run coverage` to regenerate the formal checks behind the commit‚Äìreveal
  and staking invariants.

## Inspiration to build further

This demo is intentionally opinionated. Fork `scenario.json`, adjust guardrails, and iterate on the UI to produce verticalized
missions (e.g., national debt redesign, universal carbon credit issuance). AGI Jobs v0 (v2) gives non-technical leaders the
superintelligent command surface they need to redesign economies with confidence.
