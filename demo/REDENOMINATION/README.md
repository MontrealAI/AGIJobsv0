# AGI Jobs v2 – "REDENOMINATION" Superintelligence Control Room

The **REDENOMINATION** demonstration shows a non-technical operator how to execute a
network-wide unit-of-account rebasing for AGI Jobs v2 in minutes. By combining the
`redenominationPlaybook` generator, curated configuration bundles, and a browser-based
mission control, the operator pauses production, converts every treasury balance,
and resumes the platform with audited proofs — **without writing a single line of
code**.

> **Purpose** – prove that AGI Jobs v2 turns macro-monetary maintenance into a
> guided, deterministic workflow run by policy teams rather than protocol
> engineers. The playbook maps every governance, validation, and audit action to a
> click-or-copy command while preserving the protocol's safety guarantees.

## Key capabilities

- **Governed autonomy** – the playbook enumerates all multisig checkpoints and
  pause/resume guards so community governors maintain final authority while
  automation handles the mechanics.
- **Verifiable compute** – each redenomination step emits structured artefacts
  (`ui/export/latest.json`, config bundles, ledger snapshots) that the control room
  surfaces for independent validation.
- **Anti-collusion validation** – validators remain staked at identical real-world
  amounts post-rebasing; the UI highlights committee quorum checks and
  post-migration dispute gates.
- **Institutional observability** – live dashboards render the before/after
  economics, recommended commands, and audit trails for regulators and operators.
- **One-command deployment** – `npm run demo:redenomination:control-room` generates
  the plan, rewrites module configs, serves the UI, and guides the operator through
  every click.

## Quickstart

From the repository root:

```bash
npm run demo:redenomination:export
```

The command performs the following:

1. Reads the production defaults from `config/`.
2. Computes a 1:1000 redenomination (`AGIALPHA` → `AGIΩ`).
3. Writes the human-readable playbook to
   `demo/REDENOMINATION/ui/export/latest.json`.
4. Produces ready-to-execute module configs inside `demo/REDENOMINATION/config/`.

To launch the guided control room that refreshes the export and serves the
visual dashboard:

```bash
npm run demo:redenomination:control-room
```

The CLI refreshes the playbook, hosts the UI at `http://127.0.0.1:4174`, and
listens for **Enter** to replay the redenomination drill on demand.

## What the operator receives

- **Mission playbook** – exhaustive JSON describing all governance actors,
  timeline checkpoints, and invariants.
- **Redenomination configs** – drop-in Hardhat configs for
  `updateStakeManager.ts` and `updateJobRegistry.ts` so policy teams can copy-paste
  the new parameters.
- **Audit artefacts** – pre/post supply numbers, timeline checkpoints, and required
  verification commands embed into the export for off-chain or on-chain attestors.
- **Narrated UI** – `ui/index.html` renders the plan with accessibility-first
  layouts, mermaid schematics, and multilingual-ready copy.

## Alignment and safety guarantees

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Gov as Governance Multisig
  participant Owner as Protocol Owner
  participant Validators as Validator Council
  participant Playbook as Redenomination Playbook
  participant Registry as Job Registry
  participant Stake as Stake Manager

  Gov->>Playbook: Request redenomination snapshot
  Playbook-->>Owner: Provide commands + configs
  Owner->>Gov: Submit pause proposal
  Gov-->>Registry: pause()
  Gov-->>Stake: pause()
  Owner->>Stake: apply redenominated thresholds
  Owner->>Registry: update reward/escrow bounds
  Validators->>Stake: verify stake == historical * factor
  Gov-->>Registry: unpause()
  Registry-->>Owner: emit audit events
  Playbook-->>Gov: Export invariants + references
```

- **Owner control** – the generated plan explicitly lists the module owners,
  governance safes, and policy levers they control so business operators keep
  full agency over treasury, staking, and pause mechanisms.
- **Dispute resilience** – validators are instructed to re-run commit-reveal
  checks immediately after the pause is lifted; discrepancies revert to the
  emergency pause via the same workflow.
- **Observability** – the playbook references the CI workflow and required
  verification commands so every pull request proves the demo still works.

## Continuous verification

A dedicated GitHub Actions workflow (`demo-redenomination.yml`) regenerates the
playbook, validates the JSON schema, and uploads the artefact for reviewers. Any
regression or mismatch between the checked-in configs and generated output fails
CI, guaranteeing the demo stays production-ready.

## Next steps

1. **Modify the factor** – run `npm run demo:redenomination:export -- --ratio 100`
   to explore alternative headline unit conversions.
2. **Plug in real supply data** – append `--current-supply 42000000` to build
   proof-ready before/after numbers.
3. **Wire to mainnet** – point the Hardhat commands at an Ethereum RPC endpoint
   and execute the plan with production safes and validators.

By packaging all protocol levers into a scripted plan and friendly UI, the
**REDENOMINATION** demo showcases how AGI Jobs v2 empowers institutions to steer
superintelligent labour markets with confidence.
