# AGI Jobs v0 Green-Path Execution Log

This template captures auditable evidence for each step of the AGI Jobs v0 hardening checklist. Duplicate the file when running a new environment rehearsal (e.g. `cp reports/green-path-execution-template.md reports/green-path-execution-<network>-<date>.md`). Attach referenced artifacts (command outputs, transaction receipts, governance proposals) in the `reports/` directory.

> **Usage note:** Fill in the _Status_ column with `‚úÖ` (complete), `üöß` (in progress), or `‚ùå` (blocked). Provide links to command logs, proposal payloads, or Etherscan transactions for every completed action.
