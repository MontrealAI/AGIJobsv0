# Owner Command Centre Checklist

Execute the following commands after each launch to assert sovereign control:

- `npm run owner:command-center` — Render live state of every owner module.
- `npm run owner:parameters` — Inspect configurable parameters (fees, stake thresholds, thermostat).
- `npm run owner:system-pause -- --action pause` — Engage the global pause valve for drills or incidents.
- `npm run owner:system-pause -- --action unpause` — Resume operations after validation.
- `npm run owner:upgrade-status` — Review timelocked governance proposals before execution.
- `npm run owner:verify-control` — Cryptographically verify owner supremacy across modules.
- `npm run owner:mission-control` — Summarise treasury balances and mission spend.

For emergency response run: `npm run owner:emergency` and follow the generated playbook.
