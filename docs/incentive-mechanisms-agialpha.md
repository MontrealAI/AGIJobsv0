# Incentive Mechanisms for Decentralized AGI Jobs v2 Platforms

This note details how $AGIALPHA (6 decimals) powers a tax‑neutral, reporting‑free rollout of AGI Jobs marketplaces. All mechanisms are implemented on‑chain so operators interact only through pseudonymous addresses.

## 1. Revenue Sharing via Staking
- Platform operators stake $AGIALPHA in `StakeManager`.
- A `FeePool` contract receives a protocol fee from each finalized job and periodically streams rewards to operators proportional to stake weight.
- Rewards are paid directly on‑chain; no custody of user funds or off‑chain accounting is required.

## 2. Algorithmic & Reputational Incentives
- `JobRouter` favors platforms with higher stakes when routing unspecific jobs, giving committed operators more volume.
- `DiscoveryModule` surfaces staked platforms earlier in search results and displays a stake badge as reputation.
- Validators from well‑staked platforms receive extra validation slots, improving throughput.

## 3. Governance‑Aligned Rewards
- Staked operators participate in token‑weighted votes that adjust module parameters and fee splits.
- A dedicated `GovernanceReward` contract records voters and distributes owner‑funded bonuses after each poll, linking governance diligence to revenue.

## 4. Sybil & Regulatory Mitigation
- Minimum stake gates every platform deployment; failure or misconduct can slash this collateral.
- A configurable burn percentage on each payout permanently removes tokens, countering sybil farms and increasing scarcity.
- Appeal deposits in `DisputeModule` are denominated in $AGIALPHA and may be burned or paid to honest parties, discouraging frivolous challenges.
- On-chain tax acknowledgements and blacklist thresholds are owner‑tuned, letting deployments adapt to local compliance signals while keeping addresses pseudonymous.
- Because the protocol never takes custody or issues off‑chain payouts, there is no centralized revenue that would trigger reporting duties.

## 5. Owner Controls & User Experience
- The contract owner may update fees, burn rates, stake thresholds, and even swap the token address via `StakeManager.setToken`.
- All interactions rely on simple data types, enabling non‑technical users to operate entirely through Etherscan.
- Reward flows never touch off‑chain accounts, keeping operators pseudonymous and outside traditional reporting regimes.

These incentives encourage honest participation, amplify $AGIALPHA demand, and keep all flows pseudonymous and globally tax‑neutral.
