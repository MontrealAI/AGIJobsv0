# AGIJobs v2 Deployment & Operations Guide

## Architecture Overview
AGIJobs v2 decomposes the platform into small, immutable modules wired
through a central `JobRegistry`. Each module owns a single
responsibility and exposes `onlyOwner` setters so governance can retune
parameters without redeploying the whole system.

Identity for agents and validators is enforced with the
`ENSOwnershipVerifier` library. Participants must control an ENS
subdomain—`*.agent.agi.eth` for agents and `*.club.agi.eth` for
validators—and supply the subdomain label plus Merkle proof when
interacting. The verifier checks ownership via NameWrapper and the ENS
resolver, emitting `OwnershipVerified` on success.

## Step-by-Step Deployment
1. **Deploy `StakeManager`** with constructor parameters:
   - `_token` – ERC‑20 used for staking. Pass `0` to default to
     $AGIALPHA (`0x2e8fb54C3eC41F55F06c1F082c081A609eAa4eBE`).
   - `_minStake` – minimum stake for validators and platforms (6 decimals).
   - `_employerSlashPct` / `_treasurySlashPct` – split of slashed stake.
   - `_treasury` – address receiving treasury share.
   - `_jobRegistry` and `_disputeModule` – optional module addresses.
2. **Deploy `JobRegistry`** (no constructor params) then call
   `setModules(validation, stake, reputation, dispute, certificate)` to
   wire the ecosystem.
3. **Deploy `ValidationModule`** with constructor parameters:
   - `_jobRegistry`, `_stakeManager`, `_reputationEngine` addresses.
   - `_commitWindow` and `_revealWindow` – phase durations in seconds.
4. **Deploy `ReputationEngine`, `DisputeModule` and `CertificateNFT`**
   supplying their respective constructor arguments.
5. **Configure ownership** – the deployer becomes `owner` for every
   module; transfer to a multisig if desired using `transferOwnership`.
6. **Set ENS roots** – on `ENSOwnershipVerifier` call
   `setAgentRootNode`, `setClubRootNode`, `setAgentMerkleRoot`, and
   `setValidatorMerkleRoot` with the namehashes and allowlist roots for
   your subdomains.
7. **Verify events** – confirm `ModulesUpdated`, `TokenUpdated` and
   `RootNodeUpdated` are emitted before allowing user funds.

## Interacting via Etherscan
### Job Creation
1. Approve the job reward on the staking token.
2. In `JobRegistry` → **Write**, call `createJob(reward, uri)`.
3. Watch for `JobCreated(jobId, employer, reward)` in the log.

### Staking
1. Approve tokens on `$AGIALPHA`.
2. In `StakeManager` call `depositStake(role, amount)` (0 = agent,
   1 = validator, 2 = platform).
3. `Staked(role, user, amount)` confirms the bond.

### Applying for a Job
1. Ensure your ENS subdomain is set up and whitelisted.
2. Call `JobRegistry.applyForJob(jobId, subdomain, proof)` or
   `stakeAndApply(jobId, amount, subdomain, proof)`.
3. `JobApplied(jobId, agent)` will be emitted.

### Validation
1. During commit phase, validators call
   `ValidationModule.commitValidation(jobId, commitHash, subdomain, proof)`.
2. During reveal phase, call `revealValidation(jobId, approve, salt)`.
3. After reveal, anyone may call `finalize(jobId)`.

### Dispute
1. Approve the dispute fee on `$AGIALPHA`.
2. Call `JobRegistry.raiseDispute(jobId, evidence)`.
3. Owner resolves via `DisputeModule.resolveDispute(jobId, uphold)`.
4. Monitor `DisputeRaised` and `DisputeResolved` events.

### NFT Marketplace
1. `CertificateNFT` holders list tokens by approving the marketplace and
   calling `list(tokenId, price)`.
2. Buyers call `purchase(tokenId)` after approving the token amount.
3. `TokenPurchased(buyer, tokenId, price)` confirms the sale.

## Token Configuration
- Default staking/reward token: `$AGIALPHA` at
  `0x2e8fb54C3eC41F55F06c1F082c081A609eAa4eBE` (6 decimals).
- To swap the token, the owner calls
  `StakeManager.setToken(newToken)`; emit `TokenUpdated(newToken)` to
  verify.

## Troubleshooting
- **Missing subdomain proof** – ensure your ENS label and Merkle proof
  match the configured roots.
- **Token approvals** – most functions require prior `approve` calls on
  the staking token.
- **Tax policy** – users must call `acknowledgeTaxPolicy()` on
  `JobRegistry` before staking or disputing.
- **Wrong decimals** – `setToken` only accepts ERC‑20 tokens with
  exactly 6 decimals.
