# AGI Jobs Portal – User Guides

The AGI Jobs conversational portal makes it easy for every role to participate in the
marketplace without needing to understand the underlying smart contracts. These
role-specific guides explain the workflows surfaced in the new chat-style interface and
link to additional resources for power users.

## Available guides

| Role | Guide |
| --- | --- |
| Employers | [Create and manage work requests](./employer.md) |
| Agents | [Qualify for jobs and submit results](./agent.md) |
| Validators | [Review results and commit–reveal votes](./validator.md) |

Each document includes:

- Step-by-step walkthroughs matching the prompts displayed in the portal UI
- Screenshots or descriptions of the key chat interactions, including multilingual tips
- Links to advanced documentation and smart-contract references for teams who want to
  look under the hood

## Staying up to date

The UI is designed to evolve quickly. Whenever new capabilities land, this directory will
be updated so you always have the most accurate information. You can also open a pull
request with improvements or translations—community contributions are welcome.
