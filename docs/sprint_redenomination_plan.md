# Sprint "REDENOMINATION" Implementation Plan

## Overview
Sprint "REDENOMINATION" targets transforming AGI Jobs v0 from prototype to production-grade. The initiative emphasizes governed autonomy, verifiable compute, collusion resistance, institutional observability, one-click deployment, user experience, and security.

This plan breaks the sprint narrative into actionable epics, highlights key contract and service touchpoints, and outlines deliverables, dependencies, and validation steps so that teams can execute workstreams in parallel while maintaining alignment.

## Epic 1 – Governed Autonomy
- **Decentralized Governance**
  - Deliverable: migrate privileged operations to multisig/timelock ownership for core contracts (JobRegistry, StakeManager, ValidationModule, DisputeModule).
  - Steps: inventory owner-only functions, script ownership transfer, configure timelock delay, document governance proposal flow.
  - Validation: integration tests verifying only timelock can call restricted setters.
- **Strict Role Access & Stake Requirements**
  - Deliverable: ENS ownership verification + minimum stake enforcement for agents (`*.agent.agi.eth`) and validators (`*.club.agi.eth`).
  - Steps: extend IdentityRegistry lookups, ensure StakeManager exposes configurable thresholds, add regression tests for insufficient stake/identity.
  - Validation: scenario tests covering job application and validation with/without ENS + stake.
- **Human Oversight & Safeguards**
  - Deliverable: moderator council support inside DisputeModule, emergency pause (kill-switch) guardrails via Pausable interfaces.
  - Steps: finalize moderator role configuration, expose pauser role through multisig delegation, script runbook for pause/unpause.
  - Validation: unit tests asserting disputes respect moderator quorum; fork tests of pause propagation.
- **Ethical & Policy Enforcement**
  - Deliverable: policy registry or governance-controlled allow/deny lists for task categories, admin blacklist in ReputationEngine.
  - Steps: design policy schema, integrate checks in job creation pipeline, build governance proposal templates.
  - Validation: tests blocking disallowed categories and verifying reputation blacklisting.

## Epic 2 – Verifiable Compute & Anti-Collusion
- **Trustless Result Validation**
  - Deliverable: production-ready commit–reveal validation workflow with randomized committee selection.
  - Steps: finalize randomness source (VRF/RANDAO), implement commit/reveal windows, integrate with orchestrator notifications.
  - Validation: end-to-end simulation covering successful validation and dispute trigger path.
- **Cryptographic Proofs of Execution**
  - Deliverable: enforce job result hashing (IPFS/SHA-256) and signed attestations for agent identities.
  - Steps: update result submission schema, extend Attestation registry tooling, store hashes/events for auditing.
  - Validation: tests comparing stored hash vs uploaded artifact, signature verification checks.
- **Reputation & Certificates**
  - Deliverable: on-chain reputation scoring updates, certificate NFT issuance on successful completion.
  - Steps: hook JobRegistry finalize flow to CertificateNFT contract, expand ReputationEngine weighting.
  - Validation: coverage of reputation adjustments, certificate mint event assertions.
- **Result Audits & Spot-Checks**
  - Deliverable: configurable audit pipeline for random post-validation reviews with penalties.
  - Steps: design sampling strategy, integrate with orchestrator/human moderators, tie outcomes into slashing + reputation.
  - Validation: tests simulating audit-triggered slashing, monitor for correct event emission.
- **Anti-Collusion Enhancements**
  - Randomized Validator Selection: ensure validator pool selection uses unpredictable randomness with potential reputation weighting.
  - Commit–Reveal Hardening: enforce deadlines, missing-reveal penalties, and unique salt usage.
  - Stake Slashing & Penalties: parameterize slashing tiers via governance, extend StakeManager events.
  - Hierarchical Dispute Resolution: define escalation flow to Arbitration Committee; commit–reveal for appeals.
  - Anti-Sybil Identity Checks: integrate AgentID/ValidatorID soulbound NFTs, stake per-identity requirements.

## Epic 3 – Institutional Observability
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**
  - Deliverable: ensure all critical contract actions emit events; align off-chain services with structured logging.
  - Steps: audit event coverage, extend log schema, build indexing pipeline via The Graph or custom indexer.
  - Validation: log replay tests ensuring each lifecycle stage is captured.
- **Real-Time Monitoring & Dashboards**
  - Deliverable: Prometheus/Grafana stack covering job metrics, system health, blockchain telemetry.
  - Steps: instrument services, expose metrics endpoints, design Grafana dashboards.
  - Validation: load test to confirm dashboards reflect live data.
- **Anomaly Detection & Alerts**
  - Deliverable: alerting rules and ML-based detectors for abnormal patterns.
  - Steps: define SLOs, configure alert channels (Slack/Email), integrate on-chain alert events.
  - Validation: chaos tests triggering alerts.
- **Performance & Capacity Metrics**
  - Deliverable: end-to-end metrics for gas usage, latency, throughput, system resource consumption.
  - Steps: embed telemetry libraries, document scaling thresholds.
  - Validation: performance regression suite and load-test reports.

## Epic 4 – One-Click Deployment & Operational UX
- **Containerized Package**
  - Deliverable: Docker Compose/Kubernetes manifests encapsulating all services with secure defaults.
  - Steps: publish versioned images, create `.env` templates, script secrets management.
  - Validation: CI pipeline performing smoke deploy and health checks.
- **Automated Network Configuration**
  - Deliverable: deployment CLI automating contract deployment, ENS configuration, parameter initialization.
  - Steps: update scripts in `deploy/` and `scripts/`, add prompts and validation.
  - Validation: dry-run tests on testnet/fork.
- **Secure Defaults**
  - Deliverable: configuration baseline with conservative limits, initial pause state, restricted allowlists.
  - Steps: update config templates, add documentation callouts, ensure governance can adjust post-launch.
  - Validation: configuration tests verifying restrictions.
- **Deployment Guides & Support**
  - Deliverable: refreshed non-technical deployment guide, operations runbooks, troubleshooting appendix.
  - Steps: update docs, embed screenshots/log samples, link support channels.
  - Validation: doc review, user testing sessions with non-technical stakeholders.

## Epic 5 – User Experience & Documentation

## Cross-Cutting Considerations
- **Governance Alignment**: ensure all parameter changes routed through DAO/timelock; maintain governance docs.
- **Data & Privacy Compliance**: review storage of hashes/logs, ensure GDPR and regional compliance for user data.
- **Community Engagement**: prepare public updates, request feedback on policy proposals and UX.

## Milestones
1. **Week 1-2**: Governance hardening, identity enforcement, monitoring stack scaffolding.
2. **Week 3-4**: Validation upgrades, audit logging, containerization, chat UI prototype.
