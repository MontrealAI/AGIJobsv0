# Testnet Dry-Run Evidence Template

This template standardises the artefacts collected during the
"Testnet Deployment & Dry-Run" sprint. Attach the rendered
Markdown (or exported PDF) alongside the JSON and terminal logs
generated by the automation stack so that non-technical reviewers
can confirm production readiness without rerunning the drills.

## 1. Deployment metadata

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Network | <!-- e.g. Sepolia --> |
| Deployment commit | <!-- git rev-parse HEAD --> |
| Deployer wallet / Safe | <!-- address --> |
| Dry-run harness invocation | `npm run owner:testnet:dry-run -- --network <net>` |
| Pause drill command | `npm run pause:test -- --network <net>` |
| Owner command bundle | `npm run owner:command-center -- --network <net>` |

## 2. Scenario execution summary

Paste the summary block produced by the dry-run harness:

```json
# npm run owner:testnet:dry-run -- --json
{}
```

Annotate any manual overrides or environment differences (RPC
providers, gas settings, etc.). Reference the raw JSON file stored in
`reports/<network>/dry-run.json` if additional context is required.

## 3. Emergency control rehearsal

Record the output from the pause verification script to prove the owner
(or delegated guardian) can halt and resume the system:

```text
# npm run pause:test -- --network <net>
```

Link the matching entry in the incident-response vault and confirm the
pause guardian keys were rotated or validated during this session.

## 4. Parameter management rehearsal

Summarise at least one parameter change executed via the owner control
suite. For example, use the command centre to bump a validation window
and capture the signed Safe transaction:

```bash
npm run owner:command-center -- --network <net> --out reports/<network>/owner-command-center.md
```

Document the before/after values and include a pointer to the
`ParameterUpdated` event hash on the block explorer. This satisfies the
requirement that the contract owner maintains full control over
configuration levers.

## 5. Cross-checks & sign-off

- [ ] `npm run owner:verify-control -- --network <net>` confirms owner,
      pauser, and treasury wiring matches the governance manifest.
- [ ] `npm run monitoring:validate` covers the runtime checks introduced
      during post-audit hardening.
- [ ] All artefacts archived in `reports/<network>/` and linked from the
      change ticket.
- [ ] Release manager sign-off:
  - Name:
  - Date:

Completing this template delivers the evidence package expected by the
External Audit & Final Verification sprint, demonstrating a full-scale
dry run, emergency-control drill, and configuration exercise on the
selected testnet.
