# Phase 8 Dashboard Operations Guide

The Phase 8 — Universal Value Dominance console is a self-contained, static dashboard that reads the `config/universal.value.manifest.json` file and renders governance, funding, and autonomy data for non-technical operators. This guide explains how to run through the primary usage scenarios and how to diagnose the most common failure modes.

## Prerequisites

- The static assets in `demo/Phase-8-Universal-Value-Dominance/` must be served by any static web server (for example `npx serve demo/Phase-8-Universal-Value-Dominance`).
- The manifest `config/universal.value.manifest.json` must exist and contain the outputs produced by `npm run demo:phase8:orchestrate`.
- The orchestration command should also generate the supplementary artefacts referenced by the UI: `output/phase8-orchestration-report.txt`, `output/phase8-self-improvement-plan.json`, and `output/phase8-cycle-report.csv`.

## Primary usage flows

### 1. Load the manifest and confirm global governance state

1. Serve the dashboard and open it in the browser.
2. Confirm the **Strategic Metrics** panel renders dominance score, monthly value flow, capital coverage, and improvement cadence. These values are pulled directly from the manifest totals.
3. In **Governance Control Surface**, expand each card and use the **Copy** buttons to place Safe, registry, and manifest URIs onto the clipboard before pasting them into your governance tooling.

### 2. Inspect dominions, sentinels, and capital streams

1. Review each dominion card to ensure autonomy narratives, funding levels, and sentinel coverage match the latest orchestrator run.
2. Check sentinel and stream lists for mismatches. Missing coverage or funding is highlighted with warning pills inside each dominion card.
3. Use the copy buttons on control cards when verifying addresses on-chain or in your Safe transaction builder.

### 3. Execute operator runbook actions

1. Follow the ordered steps inside **Operator Runbook** to rehearse governance updates.
2. Use the ℹ️ button to reveal plain-language guidance for each step.
3. Select **Copy** on any command to place ready-to-run CLI snippets on the clipboard. The dashboard provides confirmation text so operators know the copy operation succeeded.
4. Download the latest orchestration, self-improvement, and cycle artefacts using the provided links. These files are regenerated by `npm run demo:phase8:orchestrate`.

### 4. Visualise the Universal Value mesh

1. Scroll to the Mermaid diagram to view the relationship between guardians, capital streams, sentinels, and domains.
2. If Mermaid cannot render the SVG, the console falls back to a text representation and displays a warning so operators can still follow the flow.

## Troubleshooting

### Manifest cannot be loaded

If the dashboard shows the **Manifest unavailable** panel:

1. Confirm the file `demo/Phase-8-Universal-Value-Dominance/config/universal.value.manifest.json` exists and is accessible by the web server.
2. Re-run `npm run demo:phase8:orchestrate` to regenerate the manifest and output artefacts. This step will also refresh calldata, telemetry bundles, and download links.
3. Refresh the dashboard once the artefacts are in place. If the issue persists, review the browser console logs referenced in the error panel and consult this guide to validate file paths.

### Outputs appear stale or corrupted

1. Check the timestamps embedded in the orchestration report (`output/phase8-orchestration-report.txt`) and self-improvement plan payload (`output/phase8-self-improvement-plan.json`).
2. Regenerate artefacts with `npm run demo:phase8:orchestrate` and reload the dashboard to ensure the stats panel and runbook downloads show the refreshed values.
3. Verify that the Mermaid diagram renders. If the fallback text mode is active, inspect the console warnings for parsing errors in the manifest.

### Copy buttons do not work

1. Confirm the browser allows clipboard writes for the page. The UI will surface a red copy button state if the operation fails.
2. Use the manual values rendered next to the copy button while you adjust browser permissions, then try the copy action again.

Maintaining this workflow ensures operators always receive deterministic calldata, consistent telemetry summaries, and accessible runbook guidance without leaving the dashboard.
