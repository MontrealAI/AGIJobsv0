# Disputes

All disputes require approval from a majority of registered moderators.
Callers of `DisputeModule.resolve` must submit signatures from moderators
whose combined weight exceeds 50% of the total moderator weight. The
contract owner has no shortcut and must also collect sufficient
moderator approval before finalizing a dispute.
