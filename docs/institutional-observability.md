# Institutional Observability

AGI Jobs v0 treats observability as a first-class platform requirement so institutional operators can audit, monitor, and scale the network with confidence. This document expands on the sprint plan deliverables by detailing how audit logging, monitoring, anomaly detection, and performance instrumentation come together to deliver transparent operations.

## Comprehensive Audit Logging

* **On-chain event coverage.** Every material transition in the job lifecycle already emits an event (job creation, application, submission, validation decisions, disputes, and finalization). These contract logs form an immutable audit trail that regulators and enterprise customers can independently verify on-chain.
* **Off-chain service logs.** Orchestrator notifications, matching engine decisions, validator routing, and similar service actions record structured logs with consistent identifiers so that events can be correlated back to the job and participant involved.
* **Unified log indexing.** Indexing pipelines (The Graph or a bespoke indexer) continuously ingest on-chain events alongside off-chain logs to build a chronological narrative for each job. Administrators can replay the full history—who posted the work, which agent picked it up, how validators voted, and whether disputes were triggered—without gaps. Retention policies ensure logs remain available for regulatory record-keeping windows.

## Real-Time Monitoring & Dashboards

* **Mission-control dashboards.** Prometheus scrapes every service and contract adapter, while Grafana surfaces live views of jobs posted/completed per hour, average turnaround, active agent and validator counts, dispute frequency, and other business KPIs.
* **System health telemetry.** Dashboards also include blockchain throughput and gas cost trends, CPU and memory utilisation for orchestrator, paymaster, and supporting services, as well as queue depths and other backpressure indicators. Sudden spikes—such as a validator struggling to keep up with commits—are immediately visible.

## Anomaly Detection & Alerts

* **Rule-based and ML detection.** Alertmanager rules and ML detectors watch for deviations like plunging completion rates, sudden surges in disputes, validators voting outside their historical patterns, or unusual slashing behaviour. Smart contracts can emit dedicated `Alert` events when invariants trip, giving on-chain signals equal footing with off-chain metrics.
* **Multi-channel escalation.** Critical alerts reach operators and governance stewards through email, Slack, and Telegram. The objective is minute-level response times so issues are triaged before they cascade.

## Performance & Capacity Metrics

* **Full-stack instrumentation.** Gas consumption per transaction, block confirmation latency, job throughput, API response times, database query costs, message queue depth, and service CPU/memory utilisation are captured and trended.
* **Capacity planning.** Load-test scenarios stress the system to project when to scale orchestrator workers, add validator nodes, or optimise contracts. Dashboards flag when sustained usage approaches predefined thresholds, allowing upgrades ahead of user impact.

Together, these practices make AGI Jobs v0 operate like a flight recorder: every action is logged, the current state is observable at a glance, anomalies raise alarms immediately, and performance data informs proactive scaling. This holistic observability posture is the foundation for institutional trust.
