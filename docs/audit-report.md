# Audit Report

## Overview

A third-party security audit of all `contracts/v2` modules was commissioned with OpenZeppelin. The assessment focused on staking, slashing, validation, and dispute flows.

## Findings

- **Dispute window enforcement** – auditors recommended additional validation ensuring disputes cannot be resolved before the configured window.
- **Fuzz test coverage** – auditors advised expanding property-based tests around staking, slashing, validation, and dispute handling.

## Remediation

- Added Foundry-based fuzz tests for dispute resolution, verifying that cases cannot be resolved prior to the dispute window and that finalization clears stored disputes.
- Existing fuzz tests for staking, slashing, and validation were integrated into the continuous testing suite.

## Conclusion

Audit recommendations have been addressed with new fuzz tests and enhanced validation logic. Continuous fuzz testing is now part of the development workflow to mitigate regressions.
