# Meta-Agentic α-AGI Platform Demonstration (AGI Jobs v0/v2)

This document is the canonical reference for the Meta-Agentic α-AGI showcase. It combines only the first-class tooling that already ships with AGI Jobs v0 (v2) to deliver an iconic, production-grade rehearsal that non-technical owners can run end-to-end.

## Objectives

- **Meta-agent control** – prove the Astral Omnidominion OS demo can orchestrate deployment, simulation, manifest attestation, and governance verification in one run.
- **Nation + wallet actors** – simulate sovereign organisations and real wallet-governed coalitions via the ASI take-off harness using [`demo/meta-agentic-alpha-agi/project-plan.meta-alpha.json`](../demo/meta-agentic-alpha-agi/project-plan.meta-alpha.json).
- **Owner mastery** – expose pause/unpause, treasury rotation, thermostat updates, and validator curation through first-class CLI commands and dashboards.
- **CI parity** – align with the enforced v2 CI pipeline so every run mirrors what GitHub requires on protected branches.

## Artefact index

| Artifact | Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Launch script | [`demo/meta-agentic-alpha-agi/bin/launch.sh`](../demo/meta-agentic-alpha-agi/bin/launch.sh) | Automates the full mission using existing npm scripts. |
| Mission plan | [`project-plan.meta-alpha.json`](../demo/meta-agentic-alpha-agi/project-plan.meta-alpha.json) | Defines nations, wallet actors, validator stakes, and job topology. |
| Operator runbook | [`RUNBOOK.md`](../demo/meta-agentic-alpha-agi/RUNBOOK.md) | Non-technical step-by-step guide including UI flows and governance drills. |
| Grand summary | `reports/agi-os/grand-summary.{md,json,html}` | Executive dossier + owner control matrix generated by the demo. |
| Thermodynamic telemetry | `reports/asi-takeoff/thermodynamics.json` | Energy, entropy, and incentive adjustments for each actor role. |

## Execution flow

1. `demo/meta-agentic-alpha-agi/bin/launch.sh`
   - Runs `demo:agi-os:first-class` with `--auto-yes` to deploy contracts, run simulations, verify owner controls, and assemble manifests.
   - Runs `demo:asi-takeoff:local` with `ASI_TAKEOFF_PLAN_PATH` pointing at the meta-agentic plan to populate mission receipts.
2. Optional dashboards:
   - `docker compose up validator-ui enterprise-portal`
   - `npm --prefix apps/console run dev`
3. Governance drill:
   - `HARDHAT_NETWORK=localhost npm run owner:system-pause -- --action pause`
   - `HARDHAT_NETWORK=localhost npm run owner:system-pause -- --action unpause`
   - `npm run owner:verify-control`
4. CI alignment:
   - `npm run lint:check`
   - `npm test`
   - `npm run coverage:check`
   - `npm run ci:verify-branch-protection`

## Simulation scenario

The mission plan models four distinct first-order agents and three validators:

- `aurora.nation.agi.eth` – Arctic climate directorate with on-chain wallet `0xfA11ed…0A1`.
- `pacific.nation.agi.eth` – Pacific renewal authority controlling wallet `0xfA11ed…0B2`.
- `orbital.wallet.agi.eth` – Multisig research cooperative wallet `0xF9eD…0C3`.
- `solidarity.wallet.agi.eth` – Community relief wallet `0xF9eD…0D4`.
- Validators `gaia.validator.agi.eth`, `celestia.validator.agi.eth`, `horizon.validator.agi.eth` with explicit stake allocations.

Jobs span climate resilience, floating infrastructure, orbital labs, humanitarian drills, cross-mission validation, and owner treasury rebalancing. Thermodynamic profiles (`raise-temperature`, `double-validator-bonus`, `trigger-pause-check`) drive incentive adjustments captured in the telemetry output.

## Owner governance guarantees

The first-class demo emits `reports/agi-os/owner-control-matrix.json` confirming:

- Every module owner is the deployer or the SystemPause timelock.
- Treasury destinations, stake thresholds, thermostat temperatures, and identity overrides are configurable via provided scripts.
- Emergency pause pathways are live and exercised in the runbook.

Operators can further inspect the Mermaid diagram (`reports/agi-os/first-class/owner-control-map.mmd`) or run `npm run owner:dashboard` for a CLI snapshot.

## Deploying beyond localhost

To rehearse on Sepolia or mainnet:

```bash
export HARDHAT_NETWORK=sepolia
export RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/<key>
export PRIVATE_KEY=<governance signer>
demo/meta-agentic-alpha-agi/bin/launch.sh --network sepolia --compose
```

The same plan, runbook, and verification commands apply. Ensure wallets referenced in the mission plan are configured on-chain (ENS subdomains under `agent.agi.eth` / `club.agi.eth`) or added through the Identity Registry owner overrides (`npm run identity:update`).

## Evidence collection

After each run archive:

- `reports/agi-os/first-class/first-class-manifest.json`
- `reports/agi-os/grand-summary.html`
- `reports/asi-takeoff/mission-bundle/`
- Docker + npm command logs under `reports/agi-os/first-class/logs/`

These artefacts are deterministic and can be shared with auditors, regulators, or partners to prove operational readiness.

## Troubleshooting highlights

| Issue | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| Docker prerequisites missing | The launch script fails fast; install Docker Desktop or `docker-ce` and rerun. |
| Dashboards show empty data | Ensure `deployment-config/oneclick.env` has been regenerated by the demo; restart services. |
| Branch protection check fails | Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to ensure lint/tests/coverage/Foundry/summary jobs remain required, then rerun `npm run ci:verify-branch-protection`. |
