# AGI Jobs v2 Production Readiness Index

> **Audience:** Executive sponsors, operations leads, compliance reviewers, and contract owners who must certify that AGI Jobs v2 is deployable on short notice without writing Solidity.
>
> **Goal:** Provide a single, always-current launch dashboard that maps every readiness artifact (tests, CI, configuration, owner controls, and incident tooling) to the command or document that proves it is green.

## 1. Readiness scoreboard

| Capability | What must be green | Primary evidence | Independent verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CI v2 enforcement** | `ci (v2)` summary plus fan-out jobs required on `main` | [`docs/v2-ci-operations.md`](../v2-ci-operations.md) checklist | Branch protection API probe:<br>`gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection --jq '{required_status_checks: .required_status_checks.contexts}'` |
| **Smart contract quality gates** | Hardhat unit tests, Foundry fuzz, coverage ≥ 90 % | `npm test` → `coverage` → `forge test` sequence | Inspect the latest run under **Actions → ci (v2)** and download `coverage-lcov` |
| **Deployment manifests** | `config/*.json` (and per-network overrides) synced with deployed addresses | `npm run deploy:checklist -- --network <network>` | Compare `deployment/deployment-<network>.json` with [docs/deployment-addresses.md](../deployment-addresses.md) |
| **Owner control authority** | Governance keys can mutate every adjustable parameter | `npm run owner:doctor -- --network <network>` | Run `npm run owner:verify-control -- --network <network>` and file the Markdown proof in `reports/` |
| **Pause & recovery drills** | SystemPause and circuit breakers executable by owners | `npm run pause:test -- --network <network>` (dry-run) | Manual spot check on Etherscan `SystemPause` write tab using hardware wallet |
| **Economics calibration** | Thermodynamic constants, fee splits, burn percentages match governance policy | `npm run thermodynamics:report -- --network <network>` | Cross-verify with finance-approved baseline in `reports/<network>-economics-baseline.md` |
| **External observability** | Telemetry exporters, SLO dashboards, alerting integrations online | `npm run observability:smoke` (verifies Prometheus scrape jobs, Alertmanager routes, Grafana dashboards) | Confirm dashboard URLs listed in [`docs/institutional-observability.md`](../institutional-observability.md) respond with 200 |

> **Triple verification rule:** Do not mark a row green until the command succeeds **and** a second human has countersigned the independent verification evidence in the ops vault.

## 2. Rapid inspection commands

Run these commands whenever assessing release readiness. They produce machine-readable artefacts that auditors can replay.

```bash
# 1. Sync dependencies and regenerate deterministic artefacts
git fetch origin
npm ci
npm run compile

# 2. Execute the CI-equivalent stack locally
npm run format:check
npm run lint:ci
npm test
npm run coverage
forge test -vvvv --ffi --fuzz-runs 256

# 3. Confirm production manifests align with on-chain state
npm run deploy:checklist -- --network mainnet
npm run owner:doctor -- --network mainnet --strict
npm run owner:plan -- --network mainnet > reports/mainnet-owner-plan.csv
npm run owner:plan:safe -- --network mainnet

# 4. Validate emergency controls
tsx scripts/v2/checkSystemPause.ts --network mainnet
npm run pause:test -- --network mainnet
```

Store every generated report under `reports/` with a timestamped suffix. If any command exits non-zero, log the failure in `docs/owner-control-change-ticket.md` and block release until resolved.

## 3. Non-technical launch script

1. Print the [Non-Technical Mainnet Deployment Runbook](nontechnical-mainnet-deployment.md) and the [Production Deployment Handbook](../production-deployment-handbook.md).
2. Check the CI scoreboard: open GitHub → **Actions → ci (v2)** and confirm the latest run on `main` shows ✅ for **CI summary** and all downstream jobs.
3. Verify branch protection using the GitHub UI (Settings → Branches) **and** the CLI command listed above.
4. From an audited workstation:
   - Run `npm run owner:surface -- --network mainnet` and read the diff aloud with the governance signer.
   - Execute `npm run owner:doctor -- --network mainnet --strict`. Treat any ⚠ as a stop sign until cleared.
   - Export Safe payloads with `npm run owner:plan:safe -- --network mainnet` and circulate for multi-signature approval.
5. Execute the chosen deployment path (Truffle wizard or Etherscan) following [v2 Institutional Deployment Blueprint](v2-institutional-deployment-blueprint.md). Record every transaction hash.
6. Post-deployment, immediately run:
   - `npm run owner:verify-control -- --network mainnet`
   - `npm run wire:verify -- --network mainnet`
   - `npm run thermodynamics:report -- --network mainnet`
7. Upload artefacts (CSV plans, Safe bundle JSON, reports, and CI screenshots) to the governance document vault. Only then announce go-live.

## 4. Continuous assurance cadence

| Cadence | Task | Owner | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Daily** | Review `ci (v2)` run results and remediate failures before 12:00 UTC | Release captain | Link to passing run in ops log |
| **Weekly** | Run `npm run owner:audit -- --network mainnet --out reports/mainnet-owner-audit-<date>.md` | Governance steward | Markdown audit file stored in `reports/` |
| **Monthly** | Rotate signer list and verify against `config/identity-registry.json` | Identity manager | Signed PDF from [owner-control-change-ticket.md](../owner-control-change-ticket.md) |
| **Quarterly** | Full disaster-recovery rehearsal using [docs/disaster-recovery.md](../disaster-recovery.md) | SRE lead | Completed checklist scanned to compliance share |
| **After every change** | Update `docs/deployment-addresses.md` and rerun `npm run deploy:checklist` | Deployment engineer | Commit referencing change ticket |

Document each cadence completion inside the operations tracker and attach supporting artefacts. Missing evidence = not done.

## 5. Owner control authority snapshot

Ensure the contract owner retains complete control by confirming the following functions are callable exclusively by the owner (via Safe or hardware wallet):

- `SystemPause.setOperator`, `SystemPause.triggerGlobalPause`, `SystemPause.releaseGlobalPause`.
- `JobRegistry.setFeePct`, `JobRegistry.setTreasury`, `JobRegistry.setEscrowStake`.
- `FeePool.setBurnPct`, `FeePool.setTreasury`, `FeePool.setTreasuryAllowlist`.
- `StakeManager.setMinimumStake`, `StakeManager.setTreasuryAllowlist`, `StakeManager.setTreasury`.
- `RewardEngineMB.setRoleShare`, `RewardEngineMB.setThermostat`, `RewardEngineMB.setEnergyOracle`.
- `EnergyOracle.setSigner`, `EnergyOracle.setQuorum`, `RandaoCoordinator.setWindow`.

Cross-reference [`docs/owner-control-index.md`](../owner-control-index.md) and [`docs/owner-control-parameter-playbook.md`](../owner-control-parameter-playbook.md) for execution detail. If any setter reverts, pause deployments immediately and escalate to governance.

### Change log discipline

- Update this index whenever a new module, workflow, or control surface is introduced.
- Link all documentation edits to a tracked change ticket inside `docs/owner-control-change-ticket.md`.
- Run `npm run docs:lint` (if available) or a Markdown linter before merging documentation-only changes to keep formatting consistent.

Maintaining this index alongside the existing runbooks guarantees that the repository stays deployable by non-technical operators while satisfying institutional governance requirements.
