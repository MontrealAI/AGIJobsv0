"""Lightweight orchestration helpers for the meta-orchestrator FastAPI router.

The package exposes a deliberately small surface area so the web server can
instantiate the planner, simulator, and runner components without dragging in
the large legacy `/onebox` module.  The goal of this sprint is to provide a
structured planning → simulation → execution pipeline that future sprints can
extend with richer agent integrations.
