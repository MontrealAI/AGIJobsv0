# Echidna configuration for the CommitReveal harness.
#
# The harness exercises the commit/reveal flow and maintains an invariant
# ensuring that the internal nonce accounting never drifts from the number
# of successful reveals. The fuzzing campaign is configured in assertion
# mode so that Echidna stops immediately on counterexamples.
testMode: assertion
corpusDir: echidna/corpus/commit-reveal
# Use deterministic seeds so CI remains reproducible while still
# exploring different commit/reveal paths locally.
seed: 1337

# Limit the sequence length and the total number of executed steps so the job
# stays fast enough for PR CI while still stressing the commit/reveal flow.
seqLen: 32
testLimit: 4000
maxSteps: 200000

# Force crytic-compile to use the bundled solc compiler so the Echidna
# container does not require Foundry's `forge` binary.
cryticArgs:
  - --compile-force-framework
  - solc
