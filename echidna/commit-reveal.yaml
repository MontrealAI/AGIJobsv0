# Echidna configuration for the CommitReveal harness.
#
# The harness exercises the commit/reveal flow and maintains an invariant
# ensuring that the internal nonce accounting never drifts from the number
# of successful reveals. The fuzzing campaign is configured in assertion
# mode so that Echidna stops immediately on counterexamples.
